## Timeline Analysis

### Educational Timelines (Preserved)

**Lesson 11:** Month-by-month breakdown showing:
- Progressive win rate deterioration
- Commission/slippage death by 1000 cuts
- Specific numbers that teach the concept
**Decision:** KEEP (educational value high)

**Lesson 12:** Phase progression showing:
- Paper trading → Skipped micro → Live disaster
- Then: Paper → Micro → Live (correct path)
**Decision:** KEEP (teaches proper progression)

**Lesson 14:** COT report interpretation phases
**Decision:** KEEP (structured learning)

**Lesson 19:** Footprint chart reading examples
**Decision:** KEEP (visual learning aid)

### No Timelines (Excellent)

Lessons 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 have zero timeline entries - they use other teaching methods effectively.
