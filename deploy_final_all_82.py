    "48-institutional-order-flow.html": """• Institutional order flow = large block trades executed over time to minimize market impact
• Icebergs: Visible 100 shares, hidden 10,000 behind—institutions disguise size
• VWAP algo: Institutions buy/sell to match volume-weighted average price—creates intraday support/resistance
• Framework: Identify VWAP algo activity (volume spikes at VWAP) → Trade bounces off VWAP levels
• Validation: VWAP as support/resistance works 60-70% of time in trending markets""",

    "49-market-regime-recognition.html": """• Market regimes: Trending (directional), Ranging (choppy), Volatile (high ATR), Quiet (low ATR)
• Each regime requires different strategy: Trend-following in trends fails in ranges
• Regime indicators: ADX >25 = trending, ADX <20 = ranging, VIX >30 = volatile
• Framework: Identify regime → Apply regime-appropriate strategy → Switch when regime changes
• Validation: Regime-matched strategies outperform by 25-40%""",

    "50-auction-theory-advanced.html": """• Market operates as auction: Price discovery via bid/ask competition
• Value area: Price range where 70% of volume traded—fair value zone
• Auction fails: Price breaks value area, seeks new value = directional move
• Framework: VA breakout + volume confirmation = trade potential breakout direction → Target next VA
• Validation: VA breakouts with volume follow-through 65-75% of time""",

    "51-cross-asset-correlations.html": """• Asset correlations: SPX/Bonds -0.5, USD/Gold -0.7, Copper/SPX 0.6 (leads 2-3 weeks)
• Correlation breaks signal regime change: SPX/Bonds both rallying = unusual, watch reversal
• Lead-lag: HY credit leads stocks 1-2 weeks, copper leads stocks 2-3 weeks

• Paper trade 2-4 weeks minimum before live—catch bugs with fake money
• Add slippage to backtests: -0.15% per trade for market orders (real-world friction)
• Framework: Build → Paper trade → Add kill switches → Test all safeguards → Live with tiny size
