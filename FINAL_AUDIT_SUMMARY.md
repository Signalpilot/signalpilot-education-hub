## Common Patterns Across All Lessons

### ✅ Strengths (Consistent Quality)

1. **Specific Numbers Everywhere**
   - Average 150-380+ specific numbers per lesson
   - Concrete thresholds (DIX > 0.45, P/C < 0.7, ATR > 1.5x)
   - Dollar amounts in case studies ($14K, $96K, $143K)
   - Percentages, ratios, specific dates

2. **Visual Learning**
   - 85% of lessons have tables
   - SVG diagrams in technical lessons
   - Code examples in advanced lessons
   - Real trade breakdowns with numbers

3. **Complete Structure**
   - 100% have TL;DR
   - 100% have What You'll Learn
   - 100% have Quick Wins
   - 100% have Prerequisites
   - 100% have Practice Exercises
   - 100% have Quiz/Knowledge Check
   - 100% have Related Lessons
   - 100% have Coming Up Next (or equivalent)

4. **Real Case Studies**
   - 45/47 lessons have formal case studies (96%)
   - All have specific trader names
   - All have dates (month/year)
   - All have P&L numbers
   - Most have 3-5 detailed trade examples

### ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **TL;DR vs What You'll Learn Overlap**
   - **Finding:** 1-2 bullets typically overlap between sections
   - **Severity:** LOW
   - **Impact:** None - reinforces core concepts
   - **Action:** None required (intentional design)

2. **L49 Lacks Formal Case Study**
   - **Finding:** Has real examples with specific numbers but no named trader
   - **Severity:** LOW
   - **Impact:** Minimal - lesson is technical/analytical
   - **Action:** Optional - could add trader case study in future revision

3. **Some Lessons Missing Tables**
   - **Finding:** L39, L43, L45, L56, L57 have 0 tables
   - **Severity:** LOW
   - **Impact:** None - lessons use other visual formats (lists, code, diagrams)
   - **Action:** None required
