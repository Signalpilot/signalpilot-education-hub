# Revenge Trading Prevention Workbook

**Systems to Stop Emotional Trading After Losses**

---

## Introduction

Revenge trading is the compulsive urge to immediately "make back" a loss by taking another trade—often poorly planned and emotionally driven.

This workbook provides:
- Recognition systems
- Prevention protocols
- Recovery strategies
- Long-term habit building

## Part 1: Understanding Revenge Trading

### What Revenge Trading Looks Like

| Behavior | Normal Trading | Revenge Trading |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Trade timing | Waits for setup | Enters immediately after loss |
| Position size | Standard | Larger (to "make it back faster") |
| Risk management | Follows rules | Ignores or loosens rules |
| Setup quality | Meets criteria | "Close enough" |
| Emotional state | Calm | Frustrated, angry, desperate |
| Stop loss | Placed and respected | Widened or removed |

### The Revenge Trading Cycle

```
LOSS
  ↓
Emotional reaction (anger, frustration)
  ↓
Urge to "fix" the situation immediately
  ↓
Impulsive trade (poor setup, larger size)
  ↓
Another loss (likely)
  ↓
Intensified emotions
  ↓
More impulsive trading
  ↓
Significant drawdown
  ↓
Shame, guilt, despair
```

### Why It Happens (Neuroscience)

- **Loss aversion:** Losses hurt 2x more than equivalent gains feel good
- **Amygdala hijack:** Emotional brain overrides logical brain
- **Cortisol spike:** Stress hormone impairs judgment
- **Dopamine seeking:** Brain wants the "win" feeling back
- **Sunk cost fallacy:** "I'm already down, might as well..."

### System 2: Consecutive Loss Protocol

**After 2 consecutive losses:**

### System 3: The Pause Protocol

**Immediately after any loss:**

```
STOP → BREATHE → ASSESS → DECIDE

1. STOP: Do not touch the keyboard
2. BREATHE: 5 deep breaths (4 seconds in, 6 seconds out)
3. ASSESS: Ask "Am I about to revenge trade?"
4. DECIDE: Follow the decision tree below
```

**Decision Tree:**

```
Am I emotional right now?
│
├─ YES → Walk away for 15+ minutes
│         │
│         └─ When I return, do I still feel emotional?
│             │
│             ├─ YES → Done for the day
│             └─ NO → Continue to next question
│
└─ NO → Continue to next question

Is there a valid setup RIGHT NOW?
│
├─ YES → Does it meet ALL my criteria?
│         │
│         ├─ YES → Take at reduced size
│         └─ NO → DO NOT TRADE
│
└─ NO → DO NOT TRADE, wait for setup
```

### System 4: Physical Circuit Breakers

**Pre-commit to physical actions:**

- [ ] After X losses, I close the trading software
- [ ] After X% daily loss, I leave my desk
- [ ] I will set a timer for mandatory breaks
- [ ] I have a non-trading activity prepared

**My "walk-away" activity:**
(Something I can do immediately that takes 15+ minutes)

### Post These Where You Trade

**Before I trade:**
