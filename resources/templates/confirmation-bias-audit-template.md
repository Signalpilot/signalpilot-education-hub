# Confirmation Bias Audit Template

**Pre-Trade Checklist to Challenge Your Thesis**

## Purpose

Confirmation bias causes traders to:
- Seek information that supports their view
- Ignore information that contradicts it
- Overweight confirming evidence
- Underweight disconfirming evidence

This template forces you to actively seek reasons why your trade might be wrong.

## Section 4: Red Flag Checklist

### Emotional Check

- [ ] Am I excited about this trade? (excitement = danger)
- [ ] Am I trying to "make back" a recent loss?
- [ ] Am I forcing this because I "need" a trade?
- [ ] Have I been staring at this chart too long?
- [ ] Am I ignoring signals I'd normally respect?

### Recency Bias Check

- [ ] Did a recent win make me overconfident?
- [ ] Am I trading a "similar setup" to a recent winner?
- [ ] Am I avoiding a setup type because of recent loss?

### Anchoring Check

- [ ] Am I stuck on a price target from an earlier analysis?
- [ ] Am I holding a view from before new information?
- [ ] Have I updated my thesis with current data?

## Section 5: The Final Test

### Would I Take the Opposite?

If someone offered you the opposite side of this trade at the same R:R, would you still prefer your side?

☐ Yes, definitely my side
☐ Actually, either side seems reasonable
☐ Hmm, the opposite might be better

*If "either" or "opposite," reconsider your conviction.*

### The "Friend Test"

If a trading friend showed you this setup, what would you honestly tell them?

☐ "This looks solid, I'd take it"
☐ "It's okay, but watch out for [X]"
☐ "I'd probably pass on this one"
☐ "This seems forced"

*Be honest. We're often more objective about others' trades.*

### Kill the Trade?

Based on this audit, should I:

☐ **Proceed** — Counter-arguments are weak, thesis intact
☐ **Reduce size** — Some concerns, lower conviction
☐ **Wait** — Need more confirmation
☐ **Kill the trade** — Counter-thesis is actually stronger

## Section 6: Post-Decision Notes

### If I Took the Trade

**Did any counter-thesis points materialize?**

_____________________________________________

**What did I learn?**

_____________________________________________

### If I Killed the Trade

**What happened?**

☐ Trade would have worked — I was too cautious
☐ Trade would have failed — Good decision
☐ Trade was choppy — Unclear outcome

**Lesson:** _____________________________________________

## Using This Template

### When to Use

- Before any trade where you have strong conviction
- When you catch yourself "wanting" a trade to work

- For larger than normal positions

### How to Use

1. Fill out honestly (not to justify, but to challenge)
2. Spend actual time on the counter-thesis
3. If you can't find counter-arguments, you haven't looked hard enough
4. Use the final test to make the call
5. Review after the trade to calibrate
