## üìä Example Calculation

**Account Balance:** $50,000
**Risk Per Trade:** 1% = $500
**Entry Price:** $100.00
**Stop Loss:** $98.50
**Risk Per Share:** $1.50

**Position Size:** $500 √∑ $1.50 = **333 shares**

**Total Position Value:** 333 √ó $100 = $33,300

**Verification:**
- Risk: $500 (1% ‚úÖ)
- If stopped out: Lose exactly $500
- If hit 2.5R target: Win $1,250

## üö´ Common Position Sizing Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Using Fixed Dollar Amounts**
- ‚ùå "I always buy $10,000 worth"
- ‚úÖ Calculate based on stop distance (varies per trade)

**Mistake #2: Risking Too Much**
- ‚ùå "I'll risk 3% on this great setup"
- ‚úÖ 1% maximum, always (even on "perfect" setups)

**Mistake #3: Ignoring Portfolio Heat**
- ‚ùå "I have 6 trades open, all risking 1%"
- ‚úÖ Total heat should never exceed 4%

**Mistake #4: Not Adjusting for Correlation**
- ‚ùå "Long TSLA, NVDA, AAPL (all tech, all fall together)"
- ‚úÖ Treat correlated positions as single risk

## üìà Position Sizing by Account Size

### Small Account ($5,000-$10,000)
- 1% risk = $50-$100 per trade
- Focus on assets with tight stops
- Consider micros/fractional shares

### Medium Account ($10,000-$50,000)
- 1% risk = $100-$500 per trade
- Can trade most setups comfortably
- Scale profits into larger account

### Large Account ($50,000-$250,000)
- 1% risk = $500-$2,500 per trade
- Can diversify across multiple uncorrelated setups
- Consider position splitting for liquidity

### Very Large Account ($250,000+)
- 1% risk = $2,500+ per trade
- May need to reduce risk % to avoid liquidity issues
- Consider 0.5% risk for larger positions

## üéØ The One Rule That Saves Accounts

**"No matter how good the setup looks, never risk more than 1%."**

**Why?**
- 10 losses in a row = -10% drawdown (recoverable)
- 10 losses at 3% each = -30% drawdown (devastating)

**The math is brutal:**
- Lose 50% ‚Üí Need 100% gain to recover
- Lose 30% ‚Üí Need 43% gain to recover
- Lose 10% ‚Üí Need 11% gain to recover

**Protect your capital. Always.**

---

**Remember:**
- ‚úÖ 1% risk per trade, always
- ‚úÖ Calculate position size BEFORE entry
- ‚úÖ Check portfolio heat before adding positions
- ‚úÖ Account for correlation

**This is your survival edge.**
