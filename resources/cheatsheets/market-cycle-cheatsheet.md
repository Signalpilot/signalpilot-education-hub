| Transition | Key Signal | What to Watch |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|

## Timeframe Considerations

| Timeframe | Cycle Duration | Best For |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Weekly/Monthly** | Years | Position trading, investing |
| **Daily** | Months | Swing trading |
| **4H/1H** | Weeks | Active swing trading |
| **15m/5m** | Days | Day trading |

**Key Insight:** Cycles nest inside cycles. A daily accumulation can occur within a weekly markup.

## Common Mistakes by Phase

| Phase | Retail Mistake | Better Approach |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Accumulation** | Selling after "long decline" | Wait for signs of absorption |
| **Markup** | Waiting for pullback that never comes | Buy early breaks with stops |
| **Distribution** | Buying the "dip" at highs | Recognize exhaustion signals |
| **Decline** | Bottom-picking too early | Wait for accumulation signs |

## Quick Phase Identification

**Ask These Questions:**

1. **Is there a defined range?**
   - Yes at lows = Accumulation
   - Yes at highs = Distribution
   - No range = Trending (Markup/Decline)

2. **What's the dominant trend?**
   - Up = Markup
   - Down = Decline
   - Sideways = Accumulation or Distribution

3. **Where did we come from?**
   - After decline + at lows = Accumulation
   - After markup + at highs = Distribution
