## Pattern Quality Checklist

### Before Trading Any Reversal Pattern

- [ ] **Prior Trend Exists** — Can't reverse without something to reverse
- [ ] **Pattern Complete** — Don't anticipate, wait for confirmation
- [ ] **Volume Confirms** — Proper volume signature for the pattern
- [ ] **Location Makes Sense** — At support/resistance or key level
- [ ] **Timeframe Appropriate** — Higher TF = more reliable
- [ ] **Risk Defined** — Stop placed beyond pattern extreme

---

## Pattern Reliability Ranking

| Pattern | Reliability | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Head & Shoulders | High | Best when volume confirms |
| Double Top/Bottom | High | Second test often undershoots |
| Engulfing | Medium | Needs location context |
| Wedges | Medium | Can fail in strong trends |
| Stars | Medium | Single candle, needs follow-through |

---

## Common False Signal Filters

| Red Flag | Why It's Dangerous |
|----------|-------------------|
| No prior trend | Nothing to reverse |
| Low volume breakout | Weak conviction |
| Against higher TF trend | Fighting the current |
| At minor level | Not significant enough |
| News-driven spike | May not hold |

---

## SignalPilot Integration

| Pattern | Supporting Signal |
|---------|-------------------|
| Double Bottom | TD at second low |
| H&S Bottom | TD at head, IGN on neckline break |
| Bullish Engulfing | TD on engulfing bar |
| Double Top | WRN at second high |
| H&S Top | CAP at head, BDN on neckline break |
| Bearish Engulfing | WRN/CAP on engulfing bar |

---

## Measured Move Targets

### Formula for All Patterns

```
Target = Breakout Point ± Pattern Height

Double Bottom: Entry + (Neckline - Low)
Double Top: Entry - (High - Neckline)
H&S: Entry ± (Head - Neckline)
Wedge: Entry ± (Wedge Height at Base)
```

---

## Entry Strategies

| Strategy | Approach | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Aggressive** | Enter on pattern completion | Higher |
| **Standard** | Enter on confirmation break | Medium |
| **Conservative** | Enter on retest of breakout | Lower |

---

## Stop Placement Rules

| Pattern Type | Stop Location |
|--------------|---------------|
| Double formations | Beyond the double extreme |
| Head & Shoulders | Beyond the head |
| Wedges | Beyond the wedge extreme |
| Candle patterns | Beyond the signal candle |

**Buffer:** Add 0.5-1 ATR beyond the level
