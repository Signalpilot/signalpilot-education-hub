## How to Draw Fibonacci Retracements

### For Uptrend (Finding Pullback Support)

```
    HIGH (100%) ─────────────────── End here
         │                              ↑
         │    ╲                         │
         │      ╲                       │
         │        ╲   ← Retracement     │
    61.8%│──────────╲──────────────     │ Draw
    50.0%│────────────╲────────────     │ from
    38.2%│──────────────╲──────────     │ low
         │                ╲             │ to
         │                  ╲           │ high
    LOW (0%) ─────────────────── Start here
```

**Rule:** Click swing LOW first, then swing HIGH

---

### For Downtrend (Finding Pullback Resistance)

```
    HIGH (0%) ─────────────────── Start here
         │                  ╱           │
         │                ╱             │ Draw
    38.2%│──────────────╱──────────     │ from
    50.0%│────────────╱────────────     │ high
    61.8%│──────────╱──────────────     │ to
         │        ╱   ← Retracement     │ low
         │      ╱                       │
         │    ╱                         ↓
    LOW (100%) ─────────────────── End here
```

**Rule:** Click swing HIGH first, then swing LOW

| Price holds 61.8% | Strong trend, likely to continue |
| Price breaks 61.8% | Trend weakening, watch 78.6% |
| Price reverses at 61.8% | High-probability entry zone |

Target = C + (B - A) × Extension %
```

## Confluence Zones

### What Makes a Fib Level Stronger?

| Confluence | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Multiple timeframe Fibs** | Same level on daily + 4H |
| **Horizontal S/R** | Fib aligns with prior swing |
| **Moving average** | Fib meets 50/200 SMA |
| **Trendline** | Fib intersects diagonal support |
| **Round number** | 61.8% is also $100, etc. |

## Trading Setups

### Setup 1: Fib Pullback Entry

```
1. Identify clear trend move (swing low to high)
2. Draw Fib retracement
3. Wait for pullback to 38.2-61.8% zone
4. Look for reversal candle (hammer, engulfing)
5. Enter with stop below 78.6%
6. Target 161.8% extension
```

---

### Setup 2: Fib Cluster Zone

```
1. Draw Fib on multiple timeframes
2. Identify where levels overlap (cluster)
3. Cluster zone = high-probability reversal
4. Enter when price reaches cluster
5. Confirm with candlestick/indicator signal
```

---

### Setup 3: Fib Extension Target

```
1. Enter trade at Fib retracement
2. Draw Fib extension (A-B-C)
3. Set TP1 at 127.2%
4. Set TP2 at 161.8%
5. Trail stop after TP1 hit
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Drawing from wick to wick only | Use both wick and close |
| Forcing Fibs on choppy charts | Only use on clear swings |
| Expecting exact level bounces | Use zones (±0.5%) |
| Ignoring higher timeframes | Always check HTF Fibs |
| No other confirmation | Fibs need confluence |

## Fibonacci Quick Reference

### Memory Aid: Key Ratios

| Ratio | Approximation |
|-------|---------------|
| 0.382 | ~40% (one-third) |
| 0.500 | 50% (halfway) |
| 0.618 | ~60% (two-thirds) |
| 0.786 | ~80% |
| 1.618 | ~160% |

## Entry Checklist

### Before Entering at Fib Level

- [ ] Clear, impulsive prior move (not choppy)
- [ ] Fib drawn correctly (low→high or high→low)
- [ ] Level has additional confluence
- [ ] Price showing reversal signs at level
- [ ] Stop fits within risk management rules
- [ ] Target at Fib extension makes sense (2:1+)

## Timeframe Guidelines

| Your Trading Style | Draw Fibs On |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Scalping | 15m, 1H for context |
| Day Trading | 1H, 4H for context |
| Swing Trading | 4H, Daily for context |
| Position Trading | Daily, Weekly for context |

## Pro Tips

1. **The 61.8% level rarely breaks cleanly** — Look for wicks through, closes above
2. **Confluence beats single level** — 2+ factors > 1 factor
3. **Failed Fib levels flip** — Old support becomes resistance
4. **Extension targets stack** — 161.8% of one move may be 61.8% of another
5. **Fibs work because traders watch them** — Self-fulfilling prophecy
