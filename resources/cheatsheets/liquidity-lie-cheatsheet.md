# The Liquidity Lie Cheatsheet

**Quick Reference for Stop Hunting & Liquidity Sweep Mechanics**

---

## The Core Truth

> **"Support and resistance" levels are not barriers—they are liquidity pools where institutional traders hunt retail stops.**

---

## Where Stops Cluster (Liquidity Pools)

| Location | Why Stops Cluster Here | Institutional Play |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Below swing lows** | Retail places stops "just below support" | Sweep lows → buy the stops |
| **Above swing highs** | Retail places stops "just above resistance" | Sweep highs → sell the stops |
| **Round numbers** ($100, $50,000) | Psychological attraction points | Run the round → reverse |
| **Trend line touches** | Obvious technical levels | Break the line → trap shorts |
| **Previous day/week high/low** | Time-based reference points | Sweep → institutional entry |

## Sweep Pattern Recognition

### Bullish Sweep (Buy Setup)
```
     │
     │    ← Sweep BELOW support
  ───┼───────────  Support Level
     │    ← Stops triggered here
   ██│    ← Quick recovery candle
   ██████ ← Continuation higher
```
**Signal:** Janus Atlas marks the sweep → Price reclaims → ENTRY

### Bearish Sweep (Sell Setup)
```
   ██████ ← Rally to resistance
   ██│    ← Quick rejection candle
     │    ← Stops triggered here
  ───┼───────────  Resistance Level
     │    ← Sweep ABOVE resistance
```
**Signal:** Janus Atlas marks the sweep → Price rejects → ENTRY

## The 5-Step Sweep Sequence

| Step | What Happens | What You See |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 1. **Obvious Level Forms** | Retail identifies S/R | Multiple touches, textbook pattern |
| 2. **Stops Accumulate** | Traders place stops beyond | Order book builds at predictable spots |
| 3. **Sweep Occurs** | Price breaks level briefly | Quick spike/wick beyond level |
| 4. **Absorption Happens** | Institutions fill orders | Volume spike, delta reversal |
| 5. **Reversal Begins** | Price moves opposite direction | Reclaim candle, trend continuation |

## Real vs Fake Breakouts

| Fake Breakout (Sweep) | Real Breakout |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Wick beyond level, body reclaims | Multiple candles close beyond |
| Volume spike then immediate reversal | Volume sustains in breakout direction |
| Returns within 1-3 candles | Forms new structure beyond level |
| Janus Atlas fires sweep signal | No sweep signal, momentum continues |

---

## Stop Placement Rules

### DON'T (Retail Trap)
- Stop exactly at support/resistance
- Stop at obvious swing low/high
- Tight stops at round numbers
- Stops where "everyone else" puts them

### DO (Institutional-Aware)
- Stop BEYOND the likely sweep zone
- Add 0.5-1 ATR buffer beyond level
- Use time-based stops (if not moving, exit)
- Accept slightly larger stops, better win rate

## Quick Reference: Janus Atlas Signals

| Signal | Meaning | Action Context |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Sweep Below** | Liquidity taken at lows | Watch for bullish reversal |
| **Sweep Above** | Liquidity taken at highs | Watch for bearish reversal |
| **Double Sweep** | Both sides taken | Strong reversal likely |
| **Failed Sweep** | Sweep but no reclaim | Trend continuation in sweep direction |

## The Liquidity Lie Mindset Shift

| Old Thinking (Retail) | New Thinking (Institutional) |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| "Price bounced off support" | "Stops were hunted, then reversed" |
| "It broke resistance!" | "Is this a real break or a sweep?" |
| "My stop was hit, then it reversed" | "I was the liquidity for their entry" |
| "Trade the bounce" | "Trade the sweep reclaim" |

## Pre-Trade Checklist

- [ ] Identified obvious S/R level (where stops cluster)
- [ ] Waited for sweep (price beyond level)
- [ ] Confirmed reclaim (price back inside level)
- [ ] Janus Atlas confirms the sweep
- [ ] Volume/delta shows absorption
- [ ] Stop placed BEYOND the sweep extreme

---

## Key Statistics

- **70-80%** of retail traders place stops at obvious levels
- **60%+** of S/R "breaks" are sweeps that reverse
- **2-3x** better win rate when trading reclaims vs. breakouts

**Remember:** You are either the hunter or the hunted. Understanding where liquidity pools form—and waiting for the sweep—puts you on the right side.
