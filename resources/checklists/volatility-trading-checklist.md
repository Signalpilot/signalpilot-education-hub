## 📋 Pre-Trade Volatility Analysis

### VIX Analysis
- [ ] **Check current VIX level** - < 15 (low), 15-25 (normal), 25-35 (elevated), > 35 (crisis)
- [ ] **Compare VIX to historical average** - Is VIX above/below 20-day mean?
- [ ] **Look at VIX term structure** - VIX futures contango (calm) vs. backwardation (fear)
- [ ] **Identify VIX spike patterns** - Spikes > 20% intraday = panic (potential reversal)
- [ ] **Check VIX vs. SPY divergence** - VIX flat but SPY dropping = complacency (risk)

### Realized Volatility (Historical Vol)
- [ ] **Calculate 20-day HV** - Compare to current implied volatility (IV)
- [ ] **Check HV vs. IV spread** - If IV > HV, options expensive (sell premium)
- [ ] **Measure volatility percentile** - Is current vol in top 25% or bottom 25%?
- [ ] **Identify volatility regime** - Low vol (< 1 SD), Normal, High vol (> 1 SD)

### Bollinger Bands & ATR
- [ ] **Check Bollinger Band squeeze** - Bands narrowing = low vol (potential breakout)
- [ ] **Identify Bollinger Band expansion** - Bands widening = rising vol (trend move)
- [ ] **Measure ATR vs. 50-day average** - ATR > avg = high vol, < avg = low vol
- [ ] **Look for ATR compression** - Falling ATR = coiling (precedes expansion)

### Volatility Regime Identification
- [ ] **Low vol regime (<15 VIX)** - Sell premium, use tight stops, expect grind
- [ ] **Normal vol (15-25 VIX)** - Balanced strategies, standard sizing
- [ ] **High vol (25-35 VIX)** - Buy premium, use wide stops, reduce size
- [ ] **Crisis vol (>35 VIX)** - Stay in cash or hedge with puts

## 🎯 Volatility Trading Strategies

### Low Volatility Strategies (VIX < 15)
- [ ] **Sell credit spreads** - Collect premium in low-vol, high-probability setups
- [ ] **Use iron condors** - Profit from range-bound, low-vol environment
- [ ] **Sell covered calls** - Generate income on long positions
- [ ] **Watch for squeeze breakout** - Bollinger squeeze = prepare for expansion
- [ ] **Avoid long options** - Premium expensive relative to realized moves

### Volatility Expansion Strategies (VIX Rising)
- [ ] **Buy straddles/strangles** - Profit from large moves in either direction
- [ ] **Long VXX/UVXY (VIX ETFs)** - Direct volatility exposure (short-term only)
- [ ] **Buy protective puts** - Hedge long equity positions
- [ ] **Trade directional breakouts** - Volatility expansion = trending moves
- [ ] **Widen stops 1.5-2x** - Price swings larger, avoid premature stops

### Volatility Contraction Strategies (VIX Falling from High)
- [ ] **Fade VIX spikes** - Sell VXX/UVXY when VIX > 30 (mean reversion)
- [ ] **Buy equities at panic lows** - VIX > 40 = capitulation (contrarian long)
- [ ] **Sell puts (cash-secured)** - High IV = expensive premium to collect
- [ ] **Avoid chasing momentum** - Falling vol = slowing trends
- [ ] **Look for failed breakouts** - Low vol = breakouts more likely to fail

### Options-Specific Volatility Plays
- [ ] **IV Rank check** - Trade when IV rank > 50 (sell) or < 25 (buy)
- [ ] **Earnings volatility crush** - Sell options pre-earnings, buy after crush
- [ ] **Calendar spreads** - Profit from near-term vol spike vs. far-term decay
- [ ] **Vega positioning** - Long vega (long options) in low vol, short vega (sell) in high vol

## 📊 During Trade (Volatility Monitoring)

### Real-Time Volatility Shifts
- [ ] **Monitor VIX intraday** - Spike > 5 points = risk-off shift (exit longs)
- [ ] **Watch Bollinger Bands in real-time** - Price touching bands = extreme, likely reversal
- [ ] **Check for ATR expansion** - If ATR spiking, widen stops or reduce size
- [ ] **Look for volatility divergence** - VIX rising but SPY flat = building pressure

### Position Management by Volatility
- [ ] **Low vol:** Tighten stops, take profits at 1.5-2R (smaller moves)
- [ ] **Rising vol:** Widen stops, let runners go (larger moves possible)
- [ ] **Vol spike (VIX > 30):** Exit 50% of position, lock in gains
- [ ] **Vol crush:** If holding short premium, consider early close (collect 50-70% max profit)

### Hedge Adjustments
- [ ] **If long stocks + VIX spikes:** Buy protective puts or sell covered calls
- [ ] **If short volatility + VIX spikes:** Close position immediately (unlimited risk)
- [ ] **Rebalance delta:** Adjust options delta as volatility changes underlying moves

## 📊 Post-Trade Volatility Review

### Volatility Prediction Accuracy
- [ ] **Did volatility regime play out as expected?** - Low vol breakout? High vol mean revert?
- [ ] **Was VIX spike/drop correctly timed?** - Entry at VIX extreme or mid-range?
- [ ] **How accurate was IV vs. HV analysis?** - Did options pricing reflect actual moves?
- [ ] **Did Bollinger squeeze predict breakout?** - Direction and magnitude correct?

### Strategy Performance by Volatility Regime
- [ ] **Track win rate in low vol** - Mean reversion, credit spreads performing?
- [ ] **Track win rate in high vol** - Directional trades, long options profitable?
- [ ] **Measure avg R by vol regime** - High vol = higher R? Low vol = lower R?
- [ ] **Log volatility at entry** - Tag: Low Vol, Normal, Rising Vol, Extreme Spike

### Lessons Learned
- [ ] **Which volatility indicator most reliable?** - VIX? ATR? Bollinger Bands?
- [ ] **Did I adapt strategy to regime?** - Or forced wrong strategy in wrong vol environment?
- [ ] **How well did I time vol spikes/crushes?** - Early, late, or on-time?
- [ ] **Next improvement** - Set VIX alerts at 20/30/40, practice reading term structure

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Volatility Trading Mastery
- **VIX mean reversion is real** - VIX > 30 almost always reverts to 15-20 (time it right)
- **Don't short VIX at low levels** - VIX can spike 100%+ overnight (career risk)
- **Use volatility to size positions** - Low vol = size up, high vol = size down
- **Bollinger squeeze is predictive** - Narrow bands = coiling spring (wait for breakout)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Shorting VIX in complacency (VIX < 12 can still spike to 40+)
- ❌ Buying options in low vol (expensive premium, realized moves too small)
- ❌ Selling premium in high vol without hedge (unlimited risk in crisis)
- ❌ Ignoring vol regime when entering trades (context determines strategy)

### Volatility-Based Risk Management
- **Low vol (VIX < 15):** Risk 2% per trade, tight stops (0.5-1 ATR)
- **Normal vol (VIX 15-25):** Risk 1.5-2%, standard stops (1 ATR)
- **High vol (VIX 25-35):** Risk 1%, wide stops (1.5-2 ATR)
- **Extreme vol (VIX > 35):** Risk 0.5% or stay in cash, survive to trade another day

### VIX Pattern Quick Reference
- **VIX < 12:** Complacency (buy puts as hedge, avoid shorting VIX)
- **VIX 15-20:** Normal environment (balanced strategies)
- **VIX 20-30:** Rising fear (reduce equity exposure, buy puts)
- **VIX 30-40:** Panic (contrarian long opportunities emerging)
- **VIX > 40:** Capitulation (historical buy signal for equities)

*Remember: Volatility is cyclical. Low volatility breeds complacency, which breeds high volatility, which breeds fear, which breeds low volatility. Trade the cycle, not the moment.*
