# Order Flow Trading Checklist

**From Lesson 3: Price Action is Dead, Order Flow is King**

Use this checklist to read Time & Sales tape, interpret footprint charts, and trade with institutional order flow using Volume Oracle.

## 📋 Pre-Trade: Read the Order Flow

- [ ] **Check Time & Sales tape for aggression**
  - 3+ consecutive large aggressive orders in your direction
  - Green trades (buy aggression) for longs
  - Red trades (sell aggression) for shorts
  - Size clustering (10k+ contracts = institutional flow)

- [ ] **Analyze footprint chart patterns**
  - Imbalances (5:1 or 10:1 buy/sell ratio at price levels)
  - Absorption (high volume, price holds = strong hand)
  - Exhaustion (high volume, price rejects = move done)

- [ ] **Detect iceberg orders (optional)**
  - Order book shows same size after large volume traded
  - Institution defending a level (absorption setup)

- [ ] **Confirm Volume Oracle regime**
  - Trending: Trade WITH aggressive flow
  - Ranging: Trade mean reversion (absorption at extremes)
  - Volatile: Skip trade (conflicting signals)

## ✅ Entry Criteria (All Must Be Met)

- [ ] Volume Oracle regime supports your direction (trending or ranging)
- [ ] Janus Atlas structural confirmation (sweep, breakout, or support hold)
- [ ] Plutus Flow delta aligns with your direction
- [ ] Time & Sales shows 3+ large aggressive orders in your direction
- [ ] Footprint shows imbalance or absorption pattern (not mixed flow)
- [ ] No conflicting signals (aggressive flow both ways = wait)

## 🎯 Trade Execution

**Entry:**
- [ ] Enter after aggressive flow confirmation (not before)
- [ ] Wait for confirmation candle close
- [ ] Entry price: $________
- [ ] Order flow type: ________ (absorption / exhaustion / imbalance)

**Stop Loss:**
- [ ] Place stop beyond structure (1.5-2× ATR)
- [ ] If absorption setup: Stop below absorbed level
- [ ] If exhaustion setup: Stop beyond exhaustion zone
- [ ] Stop price: $________
- [ ] Position size: ________ (based on stop distance)

**Take Profit:**
- [ ] Target 1 (1.5R): $________
- [ ] Target 2 (2R): $________
- [ ] Target 3 (trailing): Use Pentarch events to trail

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] Order flow reverses (large aggressive orders against your position)
- [ ] Absorption fails (price breaks through absorbed level)
- [ ] Regime shifts (Volume Oracle changes to volatile)
- [ ] Footprint shows conflicting imbalances (both sides aggressive)

## 📊 Post-Trade Review

**Order flow accuracy:**
- Did aggressive flow predict the move? ________________________________________________

**Footprint patterns:**
- Which pattern worked best (imbalance/absorption/exhaustion)? ________________________________________________

**Tape reading:**
- Did you spot the institutional flow early enough? ________________________________________________

**Lesson learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________  **R-multiple:** ________

**Remember:**
- ✅ Price shows WHERE, order flow shows WHY
- ✅ Aggressive flow = conviction (market orders show urgency)
- ✅ Footprints reveal the battle (buy vs sell at each price)
- ✅ Iceberg orders = hidden institutional positioning
- ✅ Regime context is critical (same flow, different regime = different outcome)
