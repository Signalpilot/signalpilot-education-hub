# Footprint Chart Reading Checklist

**From Lesson 16: Two Identical Candles, Opposite Outcomes**

Use this guide to read footprint charts and see WHO is winning the battle at each price level.

---

## üéØ What is a Footprint Chart?

**Footprint** = Shows buy vs. sell volume at EACH price level within a candle.

**Why it matters:**
- Two candles can look identical on price chart
- But footprint reveals completely different order flow
- One shows buying strength ‚Üí continuation
- Other shows selling absorption ‚Üí potential reversal

**The edge:** You see what retail can't.

---

## üìä Footprint Chart Basics

### What You See:

**Each candle shows:**
- Price levels (rows)
- Buy volume (green, typically on right)
- Sell volume (red, typically on left)
- Delta (Buy volume - Sell volume)

**Example:**
```
Price  | Sell | Buy  | Delta
102.50 |  500 | 1200 | +700  (bullish)
102.25 |  800 |  600 | -200  (bearish)
102.00 | 2000 |  400 | -1600 (very bearish)
```

---

## üîç Step 1: Identify Key Levels

### High Volume Nodes (Where the Battle Happened):

- [ ] **Find price levels with highest volume**
  - Large numbers on both buy and sell side
  - This is where institutions traded

- [ ] **Check delta at these levels**
  - Positive delta = buyers won
  - Negative delta = sellers won
  - Large delta = decisive victory

---

### Point of Control (POC):

- [ ] **The price with most volume in the candle**
  - This is "fair value" for that period
  - Price tends to return to POC
  - Break above/below POC = directional move

---

## üìã Step 2: Read Order Flow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Buying Strength (Bullish)

**What to Look For:**
- [ ] Delta increasing as price rises
- [ ] Large buy volume at highs
- [ ] Minimal selling pressure at resistance
- [ ] Buyers lifting offers aggressively

**Candle High:**
```
103.00 | 200  | 1500 | +1300  ‚Üê Strong buying
102.75 | 400  | 1200 | +800
102.50 | 600  | 1000 | +400
102.25 | 800  |  800 | 0
102.00 | 1000 |  500 | -500
```

**Translation:** Buyers got stronger as price rose. Continuation likely.

**Trade:** Long continuation, targeting higher prices

---

### Pattern 2: Selling Strength (Bearish)

**What to Look For:**
- [ ] Delta decreasing (more negative) as price falls
- [ ] Large sell volume at lows
- [ ] Minimal buying at support
- [ ] Sellers hitting bids aggressively

**Candle Low:**
```
100.00 | 1500 | 200  | -1300  ‚Üê Strong selling
100.25 | 1200 | 400  | -800
100.50 | 1000 | 600  | -400
100.75 |  800 | 800  | 0
101.00 |  500 | 1000 | +500
```

**Translation:** Sellers got stronger as price fell. Continuation down likely.

**Trade:** Short continuation, targeting lower prices

---

### Pattern 3: Absorption (Potential Reversal - Bullish)

**What to Look For:**
- [ ] Massive sell volume at a level
- [ ] Price holds (doesn't break down)
- [ ] Buyers absorbing all the selling
- [ ] Delta stays positive or neutral despite heavy selling

**At Support:**
```
98.00 | 5000 | 5200 | +200   ‚Üê ABSORPTION!
98.25 | 1000 | 1200 | +200
98.50 |  800 | 1000 | +200
98.75 |  400 |  600 | +200
99.00 |  200 |  400 | +200
```

**Translation:** Sellers threw everything at $98, buyers absorbed it all. Selling exhausted.

**Trade:** Long reversal from support

**This is THE highest-probability footprint pattern** (extremely reliable)

---

### Pattern 4: Rejection (Potential Reversal - Bearish)

**What to Look For:**
- [ ] Massive buy volume at resistance
- [ ] Price rejected (doesn't break out)
- [ ] Sellers absorbing all the buying
- [ ] Delta stays negative despite heavy buying

**At Resistance:**
```
102.00 | 5200 | 5000 | -200   ‚Üê REJECTION!
101.75 | 1200 | 1000 | -200
101.50 | 1000 |  800 | -200
101.25 |  600 |  400 | -200
101.00 |  400 |  200 | -200
```

**Translation:** Buyers tried to break $102, sellers absorbed everything. Buying exhausted.

**Trade:** Short reversal from resistance

---

### Pattern 5: Iceberg Orders (Hidden Institutional Activity)

**What to Look For:**
- [ ] Same price level "refilling" with volume
- [ ] Large volume absorbed without price movement
- [ ] Continuous buying/selling at one price

**Example:**
```
Candle 1: 100.00 | 1000 | 3000 | +2000
Candle 2: 100.00 | 1500 | 3500 | +2000
Candle 3: 100.00 | 2000 | 4000 | +2000
```

**Translation:** Institution has hidden buy order at $100. Keeps absorbing selling. Very bullish.

**Trade:** Long with institution

---

## üéØ Step 3: Footprint + Janus Confluence

### The Power Setup:

**Combine footprint with Janus Atlas for extreme edge:**

**Bullish Example:**
- [ ] Janus marks sweep below support
- [ ] Footprint shows absorption at the low
- [ ] Price reclaims above support
- [ ] Delta reverses positive

**Confluence Score:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Extremely high accuracy when all align)

---

**Bearish Example:**
- [ ] Janus marks sweep above resistance
- [ ] Footprint shows rejection at the high
- [ ] Price fails back below resistance
- [ ] Delta reverses negative

**Confluence Score:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Extremely high accuracy)

---

## üìã Footprint Pre-Trade Checklist

**Setup Identification:**
- [ ] Identified key level (support/resistance)
- [ ] Price approaching or testing level
- [ ] Footprint pattern forming (absorption/rejection/strength)

**Footprint Analysis:**
- [ ] Volume at level: High / Medium / Low
- [ ] Delta at level: +________ / -________
- [ ] Pattern type: Absorption / Rejection / Strength / Weakness
- [ ] POC location: Above / At / Below current price

**Confluence Factors:**
- [ ] Janus sweep signal present
- [ ] Plutus CVD indicating direction
- [ ] Dark pool activity supporting thesis
- [ ] Higher timeframe alignment

**Entry Decision:**
- [ ] Clear entry trigger defined
- [ ] Stop placement identified (beyond absorption zone)
- [ ] R:R minimum 2:1
- [ ] Confidence: High / Medium / Low

## üö´ Common Footprint Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Reading Single Price Level

**‚ùå Wrong:**
- "I see positive delta at $100, going long"

**‚úÖ Correct:**
- "Positive delta at $100, but need to see if it continues as price rises"

**Fix:** Read the entire candle's footprint, not just one level

---

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Volume Context

**‚ùå Wrong:**
- "Delta is +500, that's bullish"

**‚úÖ Correct:**
- "Delta +500, but on 10K total volume vs. 100K average = weak signal"

**Fix:** Compare volume to average. Low volume delta = noise.

---

### Mistake #3: Missing Absorption

**‚ùå Wrong:**
- "Huge selling at support, going short"

**‚úÖ Correct:**
- "Huge selling at support, but price holding and buy delta absorbing = bullish"

**Fix:** Absorption (price holds despite heavy selling) = reversal signal

---

### Mistake #4: Trading Mid-Range Footprints

**‚ùå Wrong:**
- Trading every footprint pattern seen

**‚úÖ Correct:**
- Only trading footprint patterns at key levels (support/resistance)

**Fix:** Footprint most powerful at extremes, ignore mid-range

---

## üìä Footprint Pattern Recognition Practice

### Exercise 1: Identify the Pattern

**Scenario:**
Price at resistance ($105). Footprint shows:
```
105.00 | 3000 | 2800 | -200
104.75 | 1500 | 1300 | -200
104.50 | 1000 |  900 | -100
```

**What pattern is this?**
- A) Buying strength
- B) Selling strength
- C) Absorption
- D) Rejection

**Answer:** D) Rejection - Heavy buying but sellers absorbing, delta negative

**Trade:** Short the rejection

---

### Exercise 2: Absorption vs. Breakthrough

**Scenario A (Absorption):**
```
Support $98:
98.00 | 4000 | 4200 | +200  ‚Üê Buyers absorbing
98.25 |  800 | 1000 | +200
Result: Potential reversal UP
```

**Scenario B (Breakthrough):**
```
Support $98:
98.00 | 4000 | 3500 | -500  ‚Üê Sellers overwhelming
97.75 | 3000 | 2000 | -1000 ‚Üê Accelerating down
Result: Support breaks, continuation DOWN
```

**Key Difference:**
- Absorption: Price holds, delta positive or neutral
- Breakthrough: Price breaks, delta heavily negative

## üéì Pro Tips

**1. Volume Profile + Footprint = Complete Picture**
- Volume profile shows WHERE volume is
- Footprint shows WHO (buyers/sellers) won at those levels

**2. Footprint Works Best at Extremes**
- Support/resistance tests
- New highs/lows
- Sweep zones marked by Janus
- Mid-range footprint = less reliable

**3. Watch for Absorption Clusters**
- 3-5 candles of absorption at same level = very strong
- Institution likely has large order
- Price unlikely to break through

**4. Delta Divergence**
- Price making new high, but delta decreasing = exhaustion
- Price making new low, but delta less negative = exhaustion
- Divergence = reversal signal

**5. Time of Day Matters**
- First 30 min: High volume, aggressive trading
- 10:30-11:30 AM: Lower volume, patterns more reliable
- Last 30 min: Volume spike, can produce false signals

## üéØ The Ultimate Footprint Setup

**When All These Align (Highly Reliable Setup):**

1. **Key level** (major support/resistance)
2. **Janus sweep** (liquidity grab)
3. **Footprint absorption** (5K+ volume absorbed)
4. **Plutus delta reversal** (CVD turning)
5. **Price reclaim** (back above/below level)
6. **HTF alignment** (trading with higher timeframe)

**This is as close to "sure thing" as trading gets.**

**Master footprint reading. See what retail can't. Trade with precision.**
