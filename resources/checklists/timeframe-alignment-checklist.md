## 📋 Pre-Trade: 3-Timeframe Alignment Analysis

**Step 1: HTF (Higher Timeframe) - Trend & Context**
- [ ] Timeframe used: ________ (Daily or Weekly)
- [ ] Trend direction:
  - ☐ Uptrend (price above major EMAs, higher highs/lows)

- [ ] Major support/resistance levels: $________ and $________
- [ ] My bias from HTF: ________ (bullish / bearish / neutral)

**Step 2: MTF (Medium Timeframe) - Structure & Setups**
- [ ] Timeframe used: ________ (4H or 1H)
- [ ] Swing structure identified:
  - Key highs: $________
  - Key lows: $________
  - Janus sweep zones: $________

- [ ] Volume Oracle regime: ________ (trending / ranging / volatile)
- [ ] MTF structure aligns with HTF trend: ☐ YES ☐ NO
- [ ] Screenshot MTF saved: ☐ YES

**Step 3: LTF (Lower Timeframe) - Execution Timing**
- [ ] Timeframe used: ________ (15min or 1H - NOT 1-5min)
- [ ] Entry trigger identified:
  - Sweep confirmation: ☐ YES ☐ NO
  - Reversal candle: ☐ YES ☐ NO
  - Absorption/exhaustion: ☐ YES ☐ NO

- [ ] LTF setup aligns with MTF and HTF: ☐ YES ☐ NO

**Step 4: Alignment Verification**
- [ ] HTF + MTF + LTF all agree: ☐ 3/3 ☐ 2/3 ☐ 1/3
- [ ] Minimum requirement: 2/3 alignment (ideally 3/3)
- [ ] If 1/3 or mixed signals: ❌ SKIP TRADE

## ✅ Timeframe Entry Criteria (All Must Be Met)

- [ ] HTF trend identified (uptrend, downtrend, or range)
- [ ] Trading WITH HTF trend (never against it)
- [ ] MTF structure provides clear entry area and stop placement

## 🚫 Timeframe Addiction Red Flags (Break These Habits)

- [ ] Trading on 1-5min charts (dopamine addiction, not trading)
- [ ] Making 10+ trades per day (overtrading LTF noise)
- [ ] Can't look away from screen (timeframe addiction symptom)
- [ ] Analyzing HTF but executing on 1min (timeframe mismatch)
- [ ] No HTF screenshot saved (skipping context = guessing)
- [ ] Ignoring HTF trend because "LTF looks good" (alignment failure)

## 🔄 Breaking Timeframe Addiction (4-Week Plan)

**Week 1: Track Your Timeframe**
- [ ] Log every trade's execution timeframe
- [ ] Calculate: ____ % of trades are on 1-5min charts

**Week 2: Force HTF Screenshots**
- [ ] Before ANY trade, screenshot Daily and 4H
- [ ] Does LTF setup align with HTF? If NO → Skip

**Week 3: Increase Execution Timeframe**
- [ ] If trading 1min → move to 5min
- [ ] If trading 5min → move to 15min
- [ ] If trading 15min → move to 1H

**Week 4: HTF-Only Challenge**
- [ ] Trade ONLY Daily or 4H setups for 1 week
- [ ] No LTF execution allowed
- [ ] Track: Fewer trades, better R:R, less stress?

**Remember:**
- ✅ HTF guides (trend), MTF structures (entry), LTF executes (timing)
- ✅ Never trade against HTF trend (recipe for losses)
- ✅ Lower timeframes = more costs, more stress, lower returns
- ✅ Minimum 2/3 alignment (ideally 3/3)
- ✅ Stop placement from MTF structure (not LTF noise)
- ✅ Timeframe addiction is psychological (dopamine hits, not trading)
