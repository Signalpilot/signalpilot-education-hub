## 📋 Short-Term vs. Long-Term Capital Gains

### Understand Tax Rates
- [ ] **Short-term (<1 year):** Taxed as ordinary income (22-37%)
- [ ] **Long-term (>1 year):** Taxed at 0-20% (favorable rates)
- [ ] **Holding period starts:** Day after purchase
- [ ] **364 days = short-term, 366 days = long-term** (2 extra days = 17% tax savings)

### Strategic Holding Period Planning
- [ ] **If swing trading anyway** - Consider holding winners past 1 year
- [ ] **Calculate tax savings:** $100K gain × 17% difference = $17K saved
- [ ] **Balance with risk:** Holding extra days = exposure to reversal (is it worth it?)
- [ ] **Not for day traders:** If intraday strategy, ignore this (short-term unavoidable)

### Example Tax Impact
```
$100,000 gain held 364 days:
Tax (short-term, 37%): $37,000
Net: $63,000

$100,000 gain held 366 days:
Tax (long-term, 20%): $20,000
Net: $80,000

Savings: $17,000 (27% more in your pocket)
```

## 🎯 Trader Tax Status (TTS)

### TTS Qualification Criteria (IRS Requirements)
- [ ] **Substantial activity:** 750+ trades/year (guideline)
- [ ] **Regularity:** Trade most days market is open (4+ days/week)
- [ ] **Continuity:** Trading is substantial source of income
- [ ] **Intent:** Profit from short-term price movements (not long-term investing)
- [ ] **Consult CPA:** TTS is complex, professional advice required

### TTS Benefits
- [ ] **Deduct business expenses:**
  - Trading platform fees ($200/month = $2,400/year)
  - Market data subscriptions ($2,000/year+)
  - Home office deduction ($500/month = $6,000/year)
  - Computer/monitors ($5,000 amortized)
  - Education/courses ($3,000/year)
- [ ] **Estimated savings:** $10,000-$15,000/year in deductions

### TTS Application Process
- [ ] **Track trade count** - Document 750+ trades
- [ ] **Keep trade logs** - Prove regular, substantial activity
- [ ] **File Form 3115** - Change accounting method to Mark-to-Market (optional)
- [ ] **Work with CPA** - File Schedule C (business income/expenses)

## 📊 Wash Sale Rule (Avoid This Trap!)

### Wash Sale Definition
- [ ] **Rule:** Sell security at loss, buy back within 30 days = loss DISALLOWED
- [ ] **Applies to:** Same security or "substantially identical" security
- [ ] **Result:** Loss deferred, added to cost basis of new position (not ideal)

### Example Wash Sale
```
Jan 1: Buy 100 SPY @ $500 = $50,000
Jan 15: Sell 100 SPY @ $480 = $48,000 (loss: -$2,000)
Jan 20: Buy 100 SPY @ $485 (WITHIN 30 DAYS)

Result: -$2,000 loss DISALLOWED (wash sale)
New cost basis: $485 + $20 (deferred loss) = $505

You can't deduct the $2K loss this year.
```

### Avoid Wash Sales (3 Methods)
- [ ] **Wait 31+ days** - Sell at loss, wait 31 days, then rebuy
- [ ] **Buy similar (not identical) security:**
  - Sell SPY → Buy IVV or VOO (both track S&P 500, not "substantially identical" per IRS)
  - Sell QQQ → Buy QQQM (similar but different ticker)
- [ ] **Mark-to-Market (MTM) election** - Eliminates wash sale rule (but lose long-term capital gains)

### Mark-to-Market Election
- [ ] **What it does:** All positions marked "sold" on Dec 31 (paper gains/losses count)
- [ ] **Benefit:** No wash sale rule (all losses deductible)
- [ ] **Downside:** Lose long-term capital gains treatment (all short-term)
- [ ] **Good for:** Day traders (short-term only anyway)
- [ ] **Bad for:** Swing traders (want long-term rates)

## 📊 Entity Structuring (Advanced)

### Individual (Schedule D) - Default
- [ ] **Tax:** Ordinary income rates (22-37% short-term)
- [ ] **Pros:** Simple, no setup costs
- [ ] **Cons:** Highest tax, no business deductions (unless TTS)

### LLC (Pass-Through)
- [ ] **Tax:** Income + Self-Employment tax (15.3%)
- [ ] **Calculation:** $200K profit = $64K income tax + $30.6K SE tax = $94.6K total
- [ ] **Pros:** Legal protection
- [ ] **Cons:** SE tax kills you (total 47% tax rate!)

### S-Corp (Optimal for $75K+ Profit)
- [ ] **Structure:** Split profit into Salary + Distribution
  - Salary: Subject to SE tax (15.3%)
  - Distribution: NO SE tax (just income tax)
- [ ] **Example:** $200K profit split:
  - $80K salary (SE tax: $12.2K)
  - $120K distribution (SE tax: $0)
  - Total SE tax: $12.2K vs. $30.6K (LLC) = **$18K savings**
- [ ] **Threshold:** Worth it at $75K+ profit (admin costs ~$2-3K/year)

### Entity Selection Guide
```
Profit < $50K: Stay individual (simplicity)
Profit $50K-$75K: Consider TTS (deductions)
Profit $75K+: S-Corp (SE tax savings)
Profit $200K+: S-Corp (saves $15-20K/year)
```

## 📊 Tax-Loss Harvesting (December Strategy)

### Year-End Tax Planning
- [ ] **Review open positions (December)** - Which are gains? Losses?
- [ ] **Identify unrealized losses** - Can sell to offset gains
- [ ] **Calculate benefit:** Loss amount × Tax rate = Tax savings

### Example Tax-Loss Harvesting
```
Year-end positions:
- SPY: +$50K unrealized gain
- QQQ: -$15K unrealized loss
- IWM: +$5K unrealized gain

Strategy:
1. Sell SPY (+$50K gain) - Lock in profit
2. Sell QQQ (-$15K loss) - Realize loss
3. Sell IWM (+$5K gain) - Lock in profit

Net taxable gain: $50K + $5K - $15K = $40K
Tax saved: $15K loss × 37% = $5,550

Then: Wait 31 days, rebuy QQQ (maintain exposure)
Or: Buy QQQM immediately (similar but not identical)
```

## 📊 Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments

### Estimated Tax Requirements
- [ ] **Who must pay:** Self-employed, traders without withholding
- [ ] **Frequency:** Quarterly (Apr 15, Jun 15, Sep 15, Jan 15)
- [ ] **Amount:** 90% of current year tax OR 100% of prior year tax
- [ ] **Penalty:** Underpayment = IRS penalty + interest

### Calculate Quarterly Payments
- [ ] **Estimate annual income** - Based on YTD performance
- [ ] **Calculate tax owed** - Use tax software or CPA
- [ ] **Divide by 4** - Pay each quarter
- [ ] **Set aside 40% of profits** - Safe rule: 40% to taxes (federal + state)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tax Optimization Mastery
- **Track everything** - Expenses, miles, home office (TTS deductions)
- **Set aside 40% for taxes** - Don't spend all profits (tax bill in April hurts)
- **Consult CPA annually** - Tax laws change, professional advice pays for itself
- **Plan December harvest** - Tax-loss harvesting = low-hanging fruit

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Not tracking expenses (leaving $10K+ in deductions on table)
- ❌ Triggering wash sales (negates tax-loss harvesting)
- ❌ Not making estimated payments (penalties + interest)
- ❌ Using LLC instead of S-Corp at $200K profit (costs $18K/year)
- ❌ Ignoring state taxes (CA, NY = add 10-13% tax)

### Tax-Efficient Trading Practices
- **Hold winners past 1 year** (if swing trading) - 17% tax savings
- **Harvest losses in December** - Offset gains
- **Avoid wash sales** - Wait 31 days or buy similar security
- **Use tax-advantaged accounts** - IRA/401(k) for long-term holds (tax-deferred)

### Entity Structure Decision Tree
```
< $50K profit: Individual (simple)
$50-75K profit: Individual + TTS (deductions)
$75-200K profit: S-Corp (SE tax savings $10-15K)
$200K+ profit: S-Corp (SE tax savings $15-25K)
```

*Remember: Taxes are your largest expense (20-40% of gains). Optimize legally. Work with a CPA. Keep more of what you earn. Every dollar saved in taxes = 2 winning trades you don't need.*
