## üîç Divergence Identification

### Price vs. Delta Divergence (Primary Edge)

**Bullish Divergence (Price Down, Delta Up):**
- [ ] Price makes lower low (new bottom)
- [ ] Plutus CVD makes higher low (less selling pressure)
- [ ] Gap between the two lows is significant (>50% delta reduction)

**Bearish Divergence (Price Up, Delta Down):**
- [ ] Price makes higher high (new top)
- [ ] Plutus CVD makes lower high (less buying pressure)
- [ ] Gap between the two highs is significant (>50% delta reduction)

## üìã Confluence Checklist (More = Higher Probability)

- [ ] **Janus Atlas sweep at the level**
  - Liquidity sweep occurred before divergence
  - Significantly increases reliability

- [ ] **Footprint absorption visible**
  - Large delta absorption at the extreme
  - Shows institutional positioning

- [ ] **Dark pool prints detected**
  - Institutional activity opposite to price direction
  - Accumulation on down moves, distribution on up moves

- [ ] **Multi-timeframe alignment**
  - Higher timeframe supports the reversal direction
  - Not fighting the HTF trend

- [ ] **Regime confirmation**
  - Market regime supports reversal (ranging or mean-reversion)
  - Not in strong trending regime (trending overrides divergence)

## ‚úÖ Entry Criteria

**Must Have (All Required):**
- [ ] Clear divergence indicated (price vs. delta)
- [ ] Minimum 50% delta reduction on second extreme
- [ ] Price structure shows exhaustion (wicks, indecision)
- [ ] Risk/reward minimum 2:1

**Should Have (2+ for High Confidence):**
- [ ] Janus sweep signal
- [ ] Footprint absorption
- [ ] Dark pool accumulation/distribution
- [ ] HTF alignment
- [ ] Regime supports reversal

## üéØ Trade Execution

**Entry Timing:**

**Stop Loss Placement:**
- [ ] Place stop BEYOND the divergence extreme
- [ ] Buffer: 0.3-0.5% past the low/high
- [ ] Stop price: $________

## üìä Divergence Strength Scoring

**Add points for each:**
- [ ] +1: Clear delta divergence visible
- [ ] +1: >50% delta reduction
- [ ] +1: >75% delta reduction
- [ ] +1: Janus sweep present
- [ ] +1: Footprint absorption indicated
- [ ] +1: Dark pool prints support direction
- [ ] +1: HTF alignment
- [ ] +1: Regime supports reversal pattern

**Score Interpretation:**
- **7-8 points**: Extreme confidence setup (highly reliable)
- **5-6 points**: High confidence (very reliable)
- **3-4 points**: Moderate confidence (moderately reliable)
- **<3 points**: Skip this trade

**My Setup Score:** ________ / 8

## üö´ Invalidation Signals

- [ ] Price breaks past divergence extreme (stop hit)
- [ ] Delta reverses back to original direction (divergence fails)
- [ ] Higher timeframe breaks against position
- [ ] Divergence takes >5 candles to play out (exhaustion pattern failed)

## üìù Post-Trade Analysis

**Confluence factors present:**

**What indicated the divergence:**
- ________________________________________________

**What I learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Score:** ________ / 8  **Result:** Win / Loss  **R-multiple:** ________

**Key Reminders:**
- ‚úÖ Price can lie, but delta can't (someone bought/sold)
