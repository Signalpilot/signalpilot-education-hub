**Goal:** Experience real psychology with manageable risk

**Size:** 5-10% of eventual position size
- If eventual size = $10k, micro = $500-$1,000

## 🚫 Red Flags (DO NOT Graduate)

**Never Skip Stage 2 (Micro Account) - 80% Blow Up Rate**
- [ ] Skipping from sim to full size (disaster waiting to happen)
- [ ] "I've tested enough on sim" (psychology untested)

- [ ] Revenge trading incidents (emotional control lacking)
- [ ] Overconfidence from sim success ("this is easy")

## 📊 Performance Expectations (Realistic)

**Sim Performance:**
- Expectancy: ________ R per trade
- Win rate: ________ %
- Avg winner: ________ R

**Micro Performance (Expect 15-25% Drop):**
- Expectancy: ________ R per trade (likely 0.2-0.3R lower)
- Win rate: ________ % (likely 5-10% lower)
- Avg winner: ________ R (slightly lower due to slippage)

**Why the drop is NORMAL:**
- Slippage (sim = perfect fills, live = real slippage)
- Real psychology (fear/greed with real money)
- Occasional rule breaks (emotions kick in)

**If you're profitable on micro, you're doing GREAT.**

- ✅ 80% blow up from sim to full size (don't be part of this statistic)
- ✅ Paper trading teaches mechanics, micro teaches psychology
- ✅ Stage 2 is where you REALLY learn to trade (spend 6+ months here)
