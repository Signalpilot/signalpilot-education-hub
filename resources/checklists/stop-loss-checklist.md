# Stop Loss Placement & Management Checklist

**From Lesson 10: Stop Losses Don't Protect You (If Placed Like a Textbook)**

Use this checklist to place ATR-based, structure-validated stops and manage them through the trade lifecycle.

## 📋 Pre-Trade: Stop Loss Placement

**Step 1: Identify Structure Invalidation Point**
- [ ] Where is the key structure level?
  - Swept low (for longs): $________
  - Swept high (for shorts): $________
  - Support/resistance that breaks your thesis: $________

- [ ] If this level breaks, is my thesis DEAD?
  - ☐ YES (good stop placement)
  - ☐ NO (arbitrary stop, find better level)

**Step 2: Calculate ATR Buffer**
- [ ] 14-period ATR on your timeframe: $________
- [ ] ATR multiplier: ________ (1.5× for tight, 2× standard, 3× wide)
- [ ] ATR buffer: $________ (ATR × Multiplier)

**Step 3: Calculate Final Stop Price**
- [ ] Formula: Stop = Structure Level ± ATR Buffer
- [ ] Structure level: $________
- [ ] ATR buffer: $________
- [ ] Final stop price: $________ (structure ± buffer)

**Step 4: Verify 2R Target Exists**
- [ ] Stop distance: $________ (Entry - Stop)
- [ ] 2R distance: $________ (Stop distance × 2)
- [ ] 2R target price: $________ (Entry + 2R distance)
- [ ] Is there clear structure at 2R? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- [ ] If NO → ❌ SKIP TRADE (insufficient R:R)

## ✅ Stop Loss Criteria (All Must Be Met)

- [ ] Stop is based on structure (not arbitrary percentage)
- [ ] Stop has 1.5-2× ATR buffer beyond structure
- [ ] Stop placement invalidates thesis if hit
- [ ] Clear 2R target exists (minimum 2:1 risk:reward)
- [ ] Position size calculated AFTER stop distance determined
- [ ] Using HARD stop-loss order (not mental stop)

## 🎯 Stop Management During Trade

**Stage 1: Initial Stop (Set Immediately)**
- [ ] Stop price: $________
- [ ] Hard stop-loss order placed: ☐ YES
- [ ] Stop type: ________ (market / stop-limit)

**Stage 2: Move to Breakeven (+1R)**
- [ ] When price reaches +1R profit: $________
- [ ] Move stop to breakeven (entry price): $________
- [ ] Now you can't lose (worst case = breakeven)
- [ ] Breakeven stop set: ☐ YES / ☐ N/A (not yet at +1R)

**Stage 3: Partial Profits (+2R)**
- [ ] When price reaches +2R profit: $________
- [ ] Take 30-50% profits: ________ shares/contracts
- [ ] Trail remaining 50-70% with Pentarch or swing structure
- [ ] Partial profits taken: ☐ YES / ☐ N/A (not yet at +2R)

**Stage 4: Trailing Stops (Pentarch Events)**
- [ ] During RUN event: Trail stop to previous swing low/high
- [ ] During EXT event: Tighten stop aggressively (overextended)
- [ ] During BRK event: EXIT ALL (trend broken)

## 🚫 Stop Loss Red Flags (Recalculate or Skip Trade)

- [ ] Stop is based on arbitrary percentage (2% of account, not structure)
- [ ] Stop is tighter than 1.5× ATR (will get swept on noise)
- [ ] Stop is wider than 3× ATR (excessive risk, reduce position size instead)
- [ ] No clear 2R target exists (insufficient R:R ratio)
- [ ] Considering moving stop AWAY from entry (NEVER do this)
- [ ] Thinking "I'll just watch it" instead of setting hard stop (mental stops fail)

## 📊 Post-Trade: Stop Loss Review

**Stop placement accuracy:**
- Planned stop: $________
- Actual stop: $________
- Was stop hit? ☐ YES ☐ NO

**If stopped out:**
- Was thesis truly invalidated? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- Was stop too tight (swept on noise)? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- Should ATR buffer have been wider? ☐ YES ☐ NO

**If winner:**
- Did breakeven stop at +1R protect profits? ☐ YES ☐ N/A
- Did trailing stop capture most of move? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- Did I exit too early (fear)? ☐ YES ☐ NO

**Stop management mistakes:**
- Did I move stop away from entry? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- Did I remove stop mid-trade? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- Did I let emotions override stop placement? ☐ YES ☐ NO

## 💡 Stop Loss Formula Reference

**Core Formula:**
```
Stop Price = Structure Level ± (ATR × Multiplier)
```

**For Longs:**
```
Stop = Swept Low - (ATR × 2)
```

**For Shorts:**
```
Stop = Swept High + (ATR × 2)
```

**ATR Multipliers:**
- 1.5× ATR: Tight stops (scalping, mean reversion)
- 2.0× ATR: Standard stops (swing trading) ← MOST COMMON
- 3.0× ATR: Wide stops (position trading, volatile assets)

**Remember:**
- ✅ Stop where thesis DIES (structure-based, not percentage)
- ✅ Add 1.5-2× ATR buffer (gives market breathing room)
- ✅ 2R minimum target (ensures positive expectancy at 40% accuracy)
- ✅ Breakeven at +1R (eliminate risk, play with house money)
- ✅ Trail with Pentarch (RUN = hold, EXT = tighten, BRK = exit all)
- ✅ NEVER move stop away from entry (only closer or to breakeven)
