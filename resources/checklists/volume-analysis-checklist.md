# Volume & Delta Analysis Trading Checklist

**From Lesson 2: Volume Doesn't Lie, But You're Reading It Wrong**

Use this checklist to trade using delta analysis, absorption/exhaustion patterns, and volume profile intelligence with Plutus Flow.

## 📋 Pre-Trade: Analyze Volume Quality

- [ ] **Check delta alignment with your direction**
  - Longs: Require positive delta (buy volume > sell volume)
  - Shorts: Require negative delta (sell volume > buy volume)
  - Use Plutus Flow CVD for real-time delta tracking

- [ ] **Verify CVD trend alignment**
  - CVD rising = accumulation (bullish bias)
  - CVD falling = distribution (bearish bias)
  - No divergence between price and CVD

- [ ] **Identify Volume Profile levels**
  - POC (Point of Control): Fair value magnet
  - HVN (High Volume Node): Real support/resistance
  - LVN (Low Volume Node): Rejection zones (fast moves expected)

- [ ] **Recognize pattern type**
  - **Absorption:** High volume + price holds = Strong hand stepped in
  - **Exhaustion:** High volume + price rejects = Move is done

## ✅ Entry Criteria (All Must Be Met)

- [ ] Delta supports your direction (positive for longs, negative for shorts)
- [ ] CVD trending with trade direction (not diverging from price)
- [ ] Absorption or exhaustion pattern confirmed via Plutus Flow
- [ ] Entry area at or near Volume Profile POC/HVN (not in LVN gaps)
- [ ] Janus Atlas structural confirmation (sweep or breakout)
- [ ] Volume Oracle regime = trending (not volatile/choppy)

## 🎯 Trade Execution

**Entry:**
- [ ] Enter after absorption at HVN or exhaustion at resistance/support
- [ ] Entry price: $________
- [ ] Delta at entry: ________ (positive for longs, negative for shorts)

**Stop Loss:**
- [ ] Place stop beyond absorption/exhaustion zone
- [ ] 1.5-2× ATR buffer below/above key structure
- [ ] Stop price: $________
- [ ] Position size: ________ (based on stop distance)

**Take Profit:**
- [ ] Target 1 (1.5R): $________ (next HVN or POC)
- [ ] Target 2 (2.5R): $________ (HTF resistance/support)
- [ ] Target 3 (trailing): Let Pentarch RUN event guide exit

---

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] Delta reverses against your position (CVD diverges)
- [ ] Absorption fails (price breaks through absorbed level)
- [ ] Exhaustion pattern invalidated (price breaks through resistance)
- [ ] Volume Oracle regime shifts to volatile (high chop)

## 📊 Post-Trade Review

**Delta behavior:**
- Was delta aligned throughout? ________________________________________________

**Pattern accuracy:**
- Did absorption/exhaustion play out as expected? ________________________________________________

**Volume Profile effectiveness:**
- Did POC/HVN/LVN levels hold? ________________________________________________

**Lesson learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________  **R-multiple:** ________

**Remember:**
- ✅ Volume shows quantity, delta shows quality
- ✅ Absorption = strength (price holds despite volume)
- ✅ Exhaustion = weakness (price rejects despite volume)
- ✅ Trade at HVN/POC, avoid LVN gaps
- ✅ Require CVD and price alignment
