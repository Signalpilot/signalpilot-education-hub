# Moving Average & Pentarch Trading Checklist

**From Lesson 6: Moving Averages Aren't Support (Stop Buying the Touch)**

Use this checklist to trade with multi-timeframe EMA alignment and Pentarch Pilot Line 5-event system.

## 📋 Pre-Trade: Multi-Timeframe Alignment

- [ ] **HTF (Higher Timeframe): Trend Direction**
  - Timeframe: Daily (for swing) or Weekly (for position)
  - Check: Price above Daily 21 EMA = uptrend bias (longs only)
  - Check: Price below Daily 21 EMA = downtrend bias (shorts only)
  - Check: Price chopping through EMA = range (wait for clarity)

- [ ] **MTF (Medium Timeframe): Structure Confirmation**
  - Timeframe: 4H (for swing) or Daily (for position)
  - Identify swing structure and entry zones
  - Look for confluence with swept lows/highs (Janus)

- [ ] **LTF (Lower Timeframe): Execution Timing**
  - Timeframe: 15min or 1H
  - Pinpoint specific entry after HTF and MTF align
  - Wait for LTF reversal candle or sweep confirmation

- [ ] **Require 2/3 or 3/3 alignment**
  - Ideally 3/3 alignment (all timeframes agree)
  - Minimum 2/3 (with strong confluence)
  - If 1/3 or mixed = SKIP TRADE

## ✅ Entry Criteria (All Must Be Met)

- [ ] Multi-timeframe alignment (minimum 2/3, ideally 3/3)
- [ ] Pentarch event confirmation:
  - **TD (Trend Definition):** Price crosses EMA (watch for IGN next, don't enter yet)
  - **IGN (Ignition):** Price accelerates away from EMA (ENTRY SIGNAL)
  - **RUN (Run):** Sustained move without retest (hold position, trail stops)
  - **Avoid EXT (Extension):** Price very far from EMA (overextended, wait for pullback)
- [ ] Structural confirmation (Janus Atlas sweep or breakout)
- [ ] Volume confirmation (Plutus Flow delta aligned)
- [ ] Volume Oracle regime = trending (not ranging or volatile)

## 🎯 Trade Execution

**Entry:**
- [ ] Enter on IGN event (price accelerating away from EMA with momentum)
- [ ] Entry price: $________
- [ ] Pentarch event at entry: ________ (TD / IGN / RUN)
- [ ] Timeframe alignment: ____ / 3 (HTF / MTF / LTF)

**Stop Loss:**
- [ ] Initial stop: Below/above EMA or swing structure (not arbitrary %)
- [ ] During RUN event: Trail stop to previous swing low/high
- [ ] Stop price: $________
- [ ] Position size: ________ (based on stop distance)

**Take Profit:**
- [ ] Target 1 (1.5R): $________
- [ ] Target 2 (2.5R): $________
- [ ] Trailing: Use Pentarch events (RUN = hold, EXT = take partials, BRK = exit all)

---

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] BRK event (price crosses back through EMA = trend failure)
- [ ] Multi-timeframe alignment breaks (HTF trend reverses)
- [ ] EMA angle flattens (momentum dying)
- [ ] No IGN event after TD (just a fake cross, no follow-through)

## 📊 Post-Trade Review

**Timeframe alignment accuracy:**
- Did 2/3 or 3/3 alignment hold throughout trade? ________________________________________________

**Pentarch event effectiveness:**
- Which event gave the best entry (TD/IGN/RUN)? ________________________________________________

**Stop management:**
- Did trailing stops based on Pentarch work? ________________________________________________

**Lessons learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________  **R-multiple:** ________

---

**Remember:**
- ✅ EMAs describe trend, don't predict reversals
- ✅ Multi-timeframe alignment = high probability (HTF + MTF + LTF)
- ✅ Enter on IGN event (acceleration), hold through RUN, exit on BRK
- ✅ Golden Cross lags 20-30% (use Pentarch IGN instead)
- ✅ Stop below EMA, not at arbitrary % (let structure guide placement)
- ✅ Trail stops during RUN event (don't exit just because "it moved")
