# Multi-Timeframe Analysis Framework

**From Lesson 19: Single Timeframe Trading = Gambling**

Use this framework to analyze setups across three timeframes before every trade.

---

## 🎯 The Framework: HTF Guides, MTF Confirms, LTF Executes

**Rule:** Never take a trade unless at least 2 out of 3 timeframes agree.

---

## 📊 Step 1: Higher Timeframe (HTF) - Direction

**Timeframe:** (Daily / 4H / 1H - depends on your trading style)

### What to Check:

- [ ] **Trend Direction**
  - Uptrend: Higher highs, higher lows
  - Downtrend: Lower highs, lower lows
  - Range: Choppy, no clear direction

- [ ] **HTF Trend:** (Bullish / Bearish / Ranging)

- [ ] **Structure Quality**
  - Clean structure (strong trend)
  - Choppy structure (weak trend)
  - Consolidation (range-bound)

- [ ] **Support/Resistance Levels**
  - Key level above: $____________
  - Key level below: $____________
  - Currently: Near support / Mid-range / Near resistance

### HTF Signal Pilot Indicators:

- [ ] **Pentarch Pilot Line**
  - TD/IGN events: Shows trend beginning
  - RUN events: Trend continuation
  - EXT/BRK events: Potential exhaustion

- [ ] **Minimal Flow Regime**
  - Trending regime? (Green = follow pullbacks)
  - Ranging regime? (Red = fade extremes)

**HTF Verdict:** ☐ Bullish  ☐ Bearish  ☐ Neutral

**Trade with HTF?** ☐ Yes (go long if bullish, short if bearish)
**Counter-trend?** ☐ No (skip this setup - fighting HTF = low win rate)

---

## 📊 Step 2: Mid Timeframe (MTF) - Confirmation

**Timeframe:** (4H / 1H / 15min - one level below HTF)

### What to Check:

- [ ] **Structure Alignment**
  - Does MTF structure support HTF direction?
  - Potential reversal pattern forming?
  - Clean potential breakout structure?

- [ ] **MTF Trend:** (Same as HTF / Opposite / Neutral)

- [ ] **Key Question:** Does MTF structure suggest potential confirmation of HTF trend?
  - ☐ Yes → High probability setup
  - ☐ No → Wait for confirmation
  - ☐ Opposite → Skip this trade

### MTF Signal Pilot Indicators:

- [ ] **Janus Atlas**
  - Sweep detected? (liquidity grab before move)
  - Reclaim confirmed? (institutions positioned)

- [ ] **Plutus Flow**
  - Delta alignment (buying in uptrend, selling in downtrend)
  - Divergence? (warning sign or reversal setup)

**MTF Verdict:** ☐ Confirms HTF  ☐ Conflicts with HTF  ☐ Neutral

---

## 📊 Step 3: Lower Timeframe (LTF) - Execution

**Timeframe:** (15min / 5min / 1min - two levels below HTF)

### What to Check:

- [ ] **Precise Entry Trigger**
  - Waiting for: (Sweep + reclaim / Divergence / Pentarch IGN / Other)
  - Entry signal fired? Yes / No

- [ ] **Entry Quality**
  - Clean entry (all indicators agree)
  - Rushed entry (FOMO, not ideal)

- [ ] **Risk/Reward from LTF Entry**
  - Stop distance: ________ pts
  - Target distance: ________ pts
  - R:R ratio: ________:1 (minimum 2:1 required)

### LTF Signal Pilot Indicators:

- [ ] **Pentarch Pilot Line**
  - TD/IGN event for entry timing
  - Wait for IGN, don't enter on TD alone

- [ ] **Footprint Analysis** (if using)
  - Delta at entry level: Positive / Negative / Neutral
  - Absorption visible? Yes / No

**LTF Verdict:** ☐ Clean entry  ☐ Wait for better entry  ☐ Skip

## ✅ Final Decision Matrix

### Timeframe Alignment Score:

| Timeframe | Bullish | Bearish | Neutral |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| HTF | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| MTF | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| LTF | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

**Alignment Count:** ________ / 3 timeframes

### Trade Decision Rules:

**3/3 Alignment** → ⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT SETUP
- High conviction trade
- Full position size (1% risk)
- Win rate: 65-75%

**2/3 Alignment** → ⭐⭐ GOOD SETUP
- Proceed with caution
- Reduced position size (0.5% risk)
- Win rate: 55-65%

**1/3 or 0/3 Alignment** → ❌ SKIP TRADE
- Fighting multiple timeframes
- Gambling, not trading
- Win rate: 30-45%

**My Setup:** ________ / 3 aligned

**Decision:** ☐ Take trade  ☐ Wait for better setup  ☐ Skip entirely

---

## 🎯 Example: Perfect 3/3 Alignment

**HTF (Daily):** Strong uptrend, above all moving averages → **Bullish**

**MTF (4H):** Pulled back to support, bounced with volume → **Confirms bullish**

**LTF (15min):** Janus sweep at support + reclaim with delta reversal → **Clean long entry**

**Result:** All 3 timeframes bullish → High confidence long trade

---

## 🚫 Example: Failed Alignment (Skip)

**HTF (Daily):** Strong downtrend, making lower lows → **Bearish**

**MTF (4H):** Potential bullish reversal pattern forming → **Bullish**

**LTF (15min):** Looking for long entry → **Bullish**

**Result:** 2/3 bullish BUT fighting HTF → **SKIP THIS TRADE**

*Why skip?* HTF sellers will crush any counter-trend rally. Win rate drops to 30-40%.

## 📝 Multi-Timeframe Journal

**After each trade, review:**

**What was my timeframe alignment?** ________ / 3

**Did I follow the rule?**
- ☐ Yes, waited for 2+ timeframes aligned
- ☐ No, took trade with only 1 timeframe (mistake)

**If I broke the rule, why?**
- ☐ FOMO
- ☐ Impatience
- ☐ Didn't check all timeframes
- ☐ Thought "this time is different"

**Outcome:**
- Alignment score: ________
- Result: Win / Loss
- R-multiple: ________

**Lesson learned:**

## 🎓 Pro Tips

**1. Timeframe Ratios**
- Use 4:1 or 6:1 ratio between timeframes
- Example: Daily → 4H → 15min
- Example: 4H → 1H → 5min

**2. HTF Trumps Everything**
- Never fight the HTF trend
- Counter-trend trades have 30-45% win rate
- With-trend trades have 60-70% win rate

**3. Wait for MTF Confirmation**
- HTF + MTF alignment = patient entry
- Don't rush LTF entry without MTF confirmation

**4. LTF is for Timing Only**
- LTF doesn't tell you direction
- LTF tells you WHEN to enter the HTF/MTF direction
