## 📋 Pre-Trade: 3-Timeframe Analysis

### Step 1: HTF Analysis (Daily Chart)

**Trend & Context:**
- [ ] Trend direction: Uptrend / Downtrend / Range
- [ ] Price vs. 50 EMA: Above / Below / At
- [ ] Price vs. 200 EMA: Above / Below / At
- [ ] Volume Oracle regime: Trending / Ranging / Volatile

**Key Levels:**
- [ ] Major support: $________
- [ ] Major resistance: $________
- [ ] Recent swing high: $________
- [ ] Recent swing low: $________

**HTF Bias:** Long / Short / Neutral

**Rationale:**
________________________________________________

### Step 2: MTF Structure (4H Chart)

**Structure & Zones:**
- [ ] Current swing high: $________
- [ ] Current swing low: $________
- [ ] Janus Atlas sweep zones identified: $________ / $________
- [ ] Plutus Flow POC (fair value): $________
- [ ] Recent order flow: Absorption / Exhaustion

**Entry Zones Defined:**
- [ ] Potential long entry zone: $________ - $________
- [ ] Potential short entry zone: $________ - $________

**MTF Structure aligns with HTF bias?** Yes / No

---

### Step 3: LTF Execution (15min Chart)

**Entry Timing:**
- [ ] Setup type: Janus sweep / Breakout / POC reversion / Other: ________
- [ ] Entry trigger: Sweep reclaim / Breakout close / Absorption / Other: ________
- [ ] Footprint confirmation: +/- ________ delta
- [ ] Order book supporting direction: Yes / No

**Confluence check:**
- [ ] HTF aligned? ✓
- [ ] MTF structure supports? ✓
- [ ] LTF trigger confirmed? ✓
- [ ] Order flow (Plutus) confirms? ✓
- [ ] Volume Oracle supports? ✓

**Total alignment:** ____/5

## ✅ Alignment Scoring

**3/3 Perfect Alignment (Highest Probability):**
- [ ] HTF trend = Uptrend/Downtrend (clear direction)
- [ ] MTF structure = Aligned (pullback to support in uptrend, etc.)
- [ ] LTF trigger = Confirmed (sweep reclaim, breakout close)
- **Action:** Trade with high conviction, 2% risk

**2/3 Partial Alignment (Moderate Probability):**
- [ ] HTF supportive but near resistance
- [ ] MTF structure good
- [ ] LTF trigger confirmed
- **Action:** Trade with reduced size, 1-1.5% risk, tight target

**1/3 or 0/3 Conflicting (Low Probability):**
- [ ] HTF downtrend but LTF long setup
- [ ] Fighting higher timeframe
- **Action:** SKIP (Don't trade against HTF)

## 🎯 Trade Execution

**Entry:**
- [ ] Timeframe: 15min / 5min
- [ ] Entry price: $________
- [ ] Entry reason: ________________________________________________

**Stop Loss (MTF-based):**
- [ ] Stop price: $________ (below swept low / above swept high)
- [ ] Based on: MTF structure / ATR: ________ points
- [ ] Risk: $________ = ____% of account

**Targets (HTF/MTF-based):**
- [ ] Target 1 (MTF level): $________ = ____R
- [ ] Target 2 (HTF level): $________ = ____R
- [ ] Scaling plan: ___% at T1, ___% at T2

**Position size:** ________ shares/contracts

---

## 🔄 Trade Management (Use MTF)

**DO NOT manage on LTF (exit too early):**
- [ ] Using MTF for targets (4H resistance, not 15min)
- [ ] Using HTF for final target (Daily level)
- [ ] Trailing stop based on MTF structure breaks

**Management plan:**
- [ ] At T1 ($________): Exit ___% or trail stop
- [ ] At T2 ($________): Exit ___% or trail stop
- [ ] Stop moved to breakeven when: ________________________________________________

---

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] HTF structure breaks (Daily support/resistance violated)
- [ ] MTF structure breaks against position
- [ ] Volume Oracle regime shift (Trending → Volatile)
- [ ] Failed to move favorably within __ candles/hours
- [ ] Stop loss hit

## 📊 Post-Trade Review

**Alignment quality:**
- Alignment score at entry: ____/3
- Did HTF support the trade throughout? Yes / No
- Were targets based on HTF/MTF levels? Yes / No
- Did I manage on MTF (not LTF)? Yes / No

**What went right:**
- ________________________________________________

**What could be improved:**
- ________________________________________________

**Lesson learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________ **R-multiple:** ________

**Remember:**
- ✅ HTF guides (trend, bias)
- ✅ MTF indicates (structure, entry zones)
- ✅ LTF executes (precise timing)
- ✅ Never trade against HTF
