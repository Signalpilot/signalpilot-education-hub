# RSI & Harmonic Oscillator Trading Checklist

**From Lesson 5: RSI >70 Is Often a BUY Signal (Yes, Really)**

Use this checklist to interpret RSI correctly based on market regime using Harmonic Oscillator confluence and Volume Oracle.

## 📋 Pre-Trade: Identify Regime & RSI Context

- [ ] **Determine market regime (CRITICAL)**
  - Use Volume Oracle or EMA alignment (price above/below 50 EMA)
  - Trending: Price consistently above/below major EMAs
  - Ranging: Price chopping through EMAs, sideways structure
  - Volatile: Skip trade (too choppy for RSI)

- [ ] **Check RSI value and interpret by regime**
  - **TRENDING UPTREND:** RSI >50 = bullish bias, RSI >70 = momentum (stay long)
  - **TRENDING DOWNTREND:** RSI <50 = bearish bias, RSI <30 = momentum (stay short)
  - **RANGING:** RSI >70 = overbought (potential fade), RSI <30 = oversold (potential buy)

- [ ] **Check Harmonic Oscillator confluence (7 components)**
  - RSI, Stochastic RSI, MACD, EMA Trend, Momentum, Volume, Divergence Zone
  - 7/7 or 6/7 agreement = high confidence signal
  - 5/7 or less = wait for clarity (conflicting signals)

- [ ] **Look for divergence (warning signal only)**
  - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low
  - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high
  - Divergence alone is NOT entry signal (wait for structure break)

## ✅ Entry Criteria (All Must Be Met)

- [ ] Regime identified (trending or ranging via Volume Oracle or EMA)
- [ ] RSI interpretation matches regime:
  - **Trending:** Entry on RSI pullback to 40-50 (uptrend) or 50-60 (downtrend)
  - **Ranging:** Entry on RSI extremes (>70 fade, <30 buy) with Harmonic agreement
- [ ] Harmonic Oscillator shows 6-7/7 agreement (high confidence)
- [ ] Structural confirmation via Janus Atlas (sweep, breakout, or hold)
- [ ] Plutus Flow delta alignment (positive for longs, negative for shorts)
- [ ] No trading against HTF trend (never fade RSI extremes in strong trends)

## 🎯 Trade Execution

**Entry:**
- [ ] Entry price: $________
- [ ] RSI value at entry: ________
- [ ] Harmonic Oscillator agreement: ____ / 7 components
- [ ] Regime type: ________ (trending / ranging)

**Stop Loss:**
- [ ] **Trending:** Stop below/above swing structure (not based on RSI)
- [ ] **Ranging:** Stop beyond range boundary (2-3% past support/resistance)
- [ ] Stop price: $________
- [ ] Position size: ________ (based on stop distance)

**Take Profit:**
- [ ] Target 1 (1.5R): $________ (next structure level)
- [ ] Target 2 (2.5R): $________ (HTF resistance/support)
- [ ] Target 3 (trailing): Let price action guide (don't exit just because RSI hits 70/30)

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] Divergence confirmed + structural break (price breaks key level)
- [ ] RSI extreme exhaustion (>85 or <15) + price rejection
- [ ] Regime shifts (trending → volatile, ranging → trending)
- [ ] Harmonic Oscillator flips (7/7 bullish becomes 5/7 bearish)

## 📊 Post-Trade Review

**Regime accuracy:**
- Did you correctly identify trending vs ranging? ________________________________________________

**RSI interpretation:**
- Did RSI behave as expected for this regime? ________________________________________________

**Harmonic Oscillator value:**
- Did 6-7/7 agreement lead to better outcomes? ________________________________________________

**Lessons learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________  **R-multiple:** ________

**Remember:**
- ✅ RSI >70 in uptrend = continuation (NOT reversal signal)
- ✅ RSI <30 in downtrend = continuation (NOT reversal signal)
- ✅ Regime determines interpretation (trending vs ranging)
- ✅ Harmonic Oscillator 6-7/7 agreement = high confidence
- ✅ Divergence = warning, not signal (wait for structural break)
- ✅ RSI is a filter, not a trigger (always require structural confirmation)
