## 📋 Pre-Trade: Advanced Sweep Analysis

### Single Sweep Setup

- [ ] **Identify sweep level**
  - Support/resistance: $________
  - Janus marked sweep to: $________
  - Sweep depth: ________ points/ticks below support

- [ ] **Verify reclaim**
  - Reclaim within 1-3 candles? Yes / No
  - Reclaim price: $________
  - Volume spike on reclaim? Yes / No
  - Footprint delta: +/- ________ (absorption vs. exhaustion)

### Double Sweep Setup (Highest Probability)

- [ ] **First sweep detected**
  - Time: ________
  - Sweep level: $________ → $________
  - Reclaim: $________
  - Result: Rallied to $________ then returned

- [ ] **Second sweep (deeper)**
  - Time: ________ (10-60 min after first?)
  - Sweep level: $________ → $________ (DEEPER than first?)
  - Footprint delta: +/- ________ (> 5,000 = strong)
  - Reclaim: $________ (within 1-3 candles?)

- [ ] **Double sweep confirmed**
  - Second sweep cleared BOTH stop clusters (first sweep + early longs)
  - Massive absorption indicated (footprint +8,000+ delta)
  - All stops cleared, price free to move

## 🔍 Multi-Timeframe Sweep Confluence

**Check for level alignment across timeframes:**
- [ ] Daily support/resistance: $________
- [ ] 4H support/resistance: $________
- [ ] 1H support/resistance: $________
- [ ] All three align at same level? Yes / No

**If YES → Massive liquidity cluster:**
- Daily stops: Long-term traders (millions)
- 4H stops: Swing traders (hundreds of thousands)
- 1H stops: Day traders (thousands)
- **Total liquidity:** $______M+ estimated
- **Sweep probability:** Highest (A+ setup)

- [ ] Janus confirms double sweep pattern
- [ ] HTF trend supports direction
- [ ] Volume Oracle = Trending

### A+ Multi-TF Confluence Criteria:

## 🎯 Trade Execution by Pattern

### Double Sweep Trade:
- **Entry:** $________ (above second sweep reclaim)
- **Stop:** $________ (below second sweep + buffer)
- **Target 1:** $________ (previous high) = ____R
- **Target 2:** $________ (HTF resistance) = ____R
- **Position size:** ________ (2% risk, A+ setup)

### Sweep-and-Reclaim Trade:
- **Entry:** $________ (close above/below reclaim level)
- **Stop:** $________ (beyond sweep + ATR)
- **Target:** $________ (HTF level) = ____R
- **Position size:** ________ (1.5-2% risk)

## 🔴 Failed Sweep Recognition

**Signs of failed sweep:**
- [ ] No reclaim within 5 candles
- [ ] Price continues through swept level
- [ ] Negative/positive delta (opposite of expected)
- [ ] HTF structure breaking in same direction

**If failed sweep detected:**
- Time: ________
- Failed at: $________
- Breakdown to: $________
- **Action:** Exit longs / Enter shorts (trade opposite direction)
- **Stop:** $________ (above failed sweep level)
- **Target:** $________ (next support) = ____R

## 🎛️ Confluence Confirmation

**Stack these with Janus sweep:**
- [ ] Plutus Flow: CVD positive/negative? +/- ________
- [ ] Volume Oracle: Trending regime? Yes / No
- [ ] Harmonic Oscillator: Oversold/overbought? 5/5 agreement? Yes / No
- [ ] Order book: Imbalance supporting? Ratio: ________

**Total confluence:** ____/5

**If 4-5/5 → Highest conviction (A+ setup)**

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] Failed to reclaim within 5 candles (failed sweep)
- [ ] HTF structure breaks against position
- [ ] Footprint shows exhaustion (opposite delta)
- [ ] Second sweep is shallower than first (not true double sweep)
- [ ] Stop loss hit

## 📊 Post-Trade Review

**Sweep pattern analysis:**
- Pattern type: Single / Double / Multi-TF / Sweep-and-Reclaim
- Confluence score: ____/5
- Reclaim timing: __ candles (within 1-3? ✓)
- Footprint delta: +/- ________ (absorption confirmed? ✓)

**What went right:**
- ________________________________________________

**What could be improved:**
- ________________________________________________

**Lesson learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________ **R-multiple:** ________

**Remember:**
- ✅ Double sweeps = highest probability (cleared all stops)
- ✅ Multi-TF confluence = massive liquidity grab
- ✅ Sweep + reclaim within 1-3 candles = valid
- ✅ Failed sweep (no reclaim in 5 candles) = trade opposite
