# Position Sizing & Risk Management Checklist

**From Lesson 9: Position Sizing—The Only Edge That Actually Matters**

Use this checklist to calculate proper position size based on setup quality, ATR volatility, and portfolio heat management.

## 📋 Pre-Trade: Grade Your Setup Quality

- [ ] **Setup Quality Assessment**
  - **A-Grade:** 3+ confluences (sweep + absorption + HTF alignment + delta)
  - **B-Grade:** 2 confluences (clean structure + confirmation)
  - **C-Grade:** 1 or fewer confluences → ❌ SKIP TRADE

- [ ] **Risk Allocation by Grade**
  - A-Grade setup: Risk 2% of account
  - B-Grade setup: Risk 1% of account
  - C-Grade setup: DO NOT TRADE (edge insufficient)

- [ ] **My setup grade:** ________ (A / B / C)
- [ ] **Risk % for this trade:** ________ %

## ✅ Position Size Calculation (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Calculate Dollar Risk**
- [ ] Account size: $________
- [ ] Risk percentage: ________ % (A=2%, B=1%)
- [ ] Dollar risk: $________ (Account × Risk%)

**Step 2: Measure ATR & Calculate Stop Distance**
- [ ] 14-period ATR on your timeframe: $________
- [ ] Stop multiplier: ________ (1.5-2× ATR beyond structure)
- [ ] Stop distance: $________ (ATR × Multiplier)

**Step 3: Calculate Position Size**
- [ ] Formula: Position Size = Dollar Risk ÷ Stop Distance
- [ ] Calculation: $________ ÷ $________ = ________ shares/contracts
- [ ] Position size: ________ shares/contracts

**Step 4: Verify Risk**
- [ ] If stopped: ________ shares × $________ stop = $________ loss
- [ ] Does this equal your intended risk %? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- [ ] If NO, recalculate position size

## 🎯 Portfolio Heat Management

**Check Current Portfolio Heat:**
- [ ] List all open positions and their risk:
  - Position 1: $________ risk (___%)
  - Position 2: $________ risk (___%)
  - Position 3: $________ risk (___%)
  - Total portfolio heat: $________ (_____%)

**Portfolio Heat Rule:**
- [ ] Total portfolio heat must be ≤ 6% of account
- [ ] Current heat: ________ %
- [ ] Available heat: ________ % (6% - current heat)
- [ ] Can I add this trade without exceeding 6%? ☐ YES ☐ NO

**Decision:**
- [ ] If portfolio heat < 6% after this trade: ✅ PROCEED
- [ ] If portfolio heat > 6% after this trade: ❌ WAIT for a position to close

## 🚫 Position Sizing Red Flags (Do NOT Trade If ANY Apply)

- [ ] Setup quality is C-grade (insufficient edge)
- [ ] Stop distance would require position size <25% of normal (spread costs too high)
- [ ] Stop distance would require position size >200% of normal (volatility extreme)
- [ ] Portfolio heat would exceed 6% with this trade
- [ ] Emotional urge to "risk more because it's a sure thing" (overconfidence bias)
- [ ] Trying to "make back losses" with oversized position (revenge trading)

## 📊 Post-Trade: Position Sizing Review

**Position sizing execution:**
- Planned position size: ________ shares/contracts
- Actual position size: ________ shares/contracts
- Did I follow the calculation? ☐ YES ☐ NO

**Risk management:**
- Planned risk: $________ (___%)
- Actual risk: $________ (___%)
- Did stop placement match calculation? ☐ YES ☐ NO

**Portfolio heat:**
- Max portfolio heat reached this week: ________ %
- Did I stay under 6%? ☐ YES ☐ NO

**Sizing mistakes:**
- Did I oversize due to emotion? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- Did I undersize due to fear? ☐ YES ☐ NO
- Lesson learned: ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________  **R-multiple:** ________

## 💡 Position Sizing Formula Reference

**Core Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Account Size × Risk %) ÷ Stop Distance
```

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Risk: 2% (A-grade setup)
- Dollar risk: $200
- ATR: $1.50
- Stop distance: $3.00 (2× ATR)
- Position size: $200 ÷ $3.00 = 66.67 shares (round to 67)

**Verification:**
- 67 shares × $3.00 stop = $201 loss (≈ 2.01% of account) ✅

---

**Remember:**
- ✅ Size to setup quality (A=2%, B=1%, C=skip)
- ✅ Use ATR for stop distance (1.5-2× beyond structure)
- ✅ Formula: (Account × Risk%) ÷ Stop Distance = Position Size
- ✅ Portfolio heat rule: Never exceed 6% total risk
- ✅ Wider ATR = smaller position size (auto-scales to volatility)
- ✅ Control risk via SIZE, not stop distance (wide stop + small size > tight stop + big size)
