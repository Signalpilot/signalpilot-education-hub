## 📋 Pre-Trade: Volume Profile Analysis

### Step 1: Identify POC (Point of Control)

- [ ] **Mark POC on chart**
  - Current POC: $________ (highest volume node)
  - POC timeframe: Daily / Session / 4H
  - Distance from current price: ________ points (%: _____)

- [ ] **Check POC migration**
  - Yesterday's POC: $________
  - Today's POC: $________
  - POC migrating? Yes / No (moving with price = strong trend)

### Step 2: Map Value Area

- [ ] **Value Area range (70% of volume)**
  - Value Area High (VAH): $________
  - Value Area Low (VAL): $________
  - Current price position: Above VA / Inside VA / Below VA

- [ ] **Interpretation:**
  - Above VA = Overvalued (expect pullback to POC)
  - Below VA = Undervalued (expect rally to POC)
  - Inside VA = Fair value (consolidation/chop)

### Step 3: Mark HVN/LVN

- [ ] **High Volume Nodes (HVN)** - Support/Resistance:
  - HVN 1: $________
  - HVN 2: $________
  - HVN 3: $________

- [ ] **Low Volume Nodes (LVN)** - Fast Move Zones:
  - LVN 1: $________
  - LVN 2: $________

## ✅ Trading Strategy Selection

### Strategy A: Mean Reversion to POC

**Setup:**
- [ ] Price far from POC (> 2% away)
- [ ] Current price: $________
- [ ] POC: $________
- [ ] Volume Oracle: Ranging regime (mean reversion favored)
- [ ] No strong HTF directional bias

**Execution:**
- **Entry:** $________ (when price approaches POC)
- **Stop:** $________ (beyond POC + buffer)
- **Target:** $________ (opposite side of value area) = ____R
- **Position size:** ________ (1% risk, B-grade setup)

### Strategy B: POC Breakout with Migration

**Setup:**
- [ ] POC migrating higher/lower (trend confirmed)
- [ ] Price at POC after pullback
- [ ] Volume Oracle: Trending regime
- [ ] HTF trend supports direction
- [ ] Plutus CVD positive/negative (aligned)

**Execution:**
- **Entry:** $________ (at POC support/resistance)
- **Stop:** $________ (below POC + ATR)
- **Target 1:** $________ (next HVN) = ____R
- **Target 2:** $________ (HTF level) = ____R
- **Position size:** ________ (2% risk, A-grade setup)

### Strategy C: LVN Fast Move

**Setup:**
- [ ] Price approaching LVN: $________
- [ ] Low volume at this level (thin acceptance)
- [ ] Breakout imminent (building pressure)
- [ ] Target: Next HVN at $________

**Execution:**
- **Entry:** $________ (breakout through LVN)
- **Stop:** $________ (back inside LVN)
- **Target:** $________ (next HVN) = ____R
- **Position size:** ________ (1.5% risk)

## 🔍 CVD Divergence Analysis

### Bullish CVD Divergence:
- [ ] Price lower low: $________
- [ ] CVD higher low: +________ (less selling pressure)
- [ ] Janus sweep at structure: $________
- [ ] Footprint absorption: +________ delta
- [ ] **Trade:** Long on reversal confirmation

### Bearish CVD Divergence:
- [ ] Price higher high: $________
- [ ] CVD lower high: -________ (less buying pressure)
- [ ] Price at HTF resistance: $________
- [ ] Footprint exhaustion: -________ delta
- [ ] **Trade:** Short on breakdown confirmation

**CVD Divergence Checklist:**
- [ ] Divergence spans 3+ candles
- [ ] Confirmed by price structure (swing high/low)
- [ ] Footprint shows absorption/exhaustion
- [ ] HTF supports reversal direction

## 🎯 POC Trade Execution

**Entry timing:**
- [ ] Price within ±0.5% of POC
- [ ] Order flow confirms (CVD, footprint)
- [ ] Volume Oracle regime appropriate
- [ ] Janus sweep or structure test completed

**Position management:**
- **Entry:** $________
- **Stop:** $________ (structure-based, not arbitrary)
- **Target:** $________ (HVN, VAH/VAL, or HTF level)
- **Risk:** $________ = ____% of account
- **R:R:** ____:1 (minimum 2:1)

## 🔄 POC Migration Tracking

**Daily POC tracking:**
- Day 1: POC at $________
- Day 2: POC at $________ (moved +/- ________?)
- Day 3: POC at $________ (trend continuation?)

**Interpretation:**
- [ ] POC migrating UP = Strong uptrend (buy pullbacks to POC)
- [ ] POC migrating DOWN = Strong downtrend (sell rallies to POC)
- [ ] POC static = Weak trend (expect reversion to POC)

**Trading rule:**
- If POC migrating: Trade WITH trend (pullbacks to POC = opportunity)
- If POC static: Trade mean reversion (fade extremes to POC)

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] POC breaks and doesn't reclaim (structure failure)
- [ ] CVD divergence fails (price continues in original direction)
- [ ] Volume Oracle regime shifts (Trending → Volatile)
- [ ] Price moves through LVN without acceleration (weak breakout)
- [ ] Stop loss hit

## 📊 Post-Trade Review

**Volume profile effectiveness:**
- Was POC accurate as magnet/support? Yes / No
- Did HVN/LVN behave as expected? Yes / No
- CVD divergence reliable? Yes / No
- POC migration predicted trend strength? Yes / No

**What went right:**
- ________________________________________________

**What could be improved:**
- ________________________________________________

**Lesson learned:**
- ________________________________________________

**Win/Loss:** ________ **R-multiple:** ________

---

**Remember:**
- ✅ POC = fair value (price gravitates toward it)
- ✅ POC migration = trend strength indicator
- ✅ HVN = likely to hold (support/resistance)
- ✅ LVN = likely to break fast (minimal resistance)
- ✅ CVD divergence = reversal warning
