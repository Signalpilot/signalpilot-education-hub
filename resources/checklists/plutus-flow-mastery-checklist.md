## 📋 Pre-Trade: OBV Analysis

### Step 1: Assess OBV Trend Direction

- [ ] **OBV line direction**
  - Currently: Rising / Falling / Flat
  - Interpretation: Accumulation / Distribution / Unclear

- [ ] **Flow ribbon color**
  - Current ribbon: Green (above basis) / Red (below basis)
  - Ribbon expanding or contracting?

### Step 2: Check Statistical Bands

- [ ] **OBV position relative to bands**
  - Above upper band (+2σ)? = Overbought conditions
  - Below lower band (-2σ)? = Oversold conditions
  - Inside bands? = Normal conditions

- [ ] **Recent extreme zone markers**
  - White dots (entering extreme)? Yes / No
  - Yellow dots (exiting extreme)? Yes / No

### Step 3: Look for Divergences

- [ ] **Check for divergence labels**
  - Bull Div (price lower low, OBV higher low)? Yes / No
  - Bear Div (price higher high, OBV lower high)? Yes / No
  - Bull Hid (price higher low, OBV lower low)? Yes / No
  - Bear Hid (price lower high, OBV higher high)? Yes / No

## 🔄 Flow State Tracking

**Current market flow:**
- [ ] OBV rising steadily = Accumulation in progress
- [ ] OBV falling steadily = Distribution in progress
- [ ] OBV flat/choppy = No clear flow direction

**Flow ribbon history (last 5 bars):**
- [ ] Consistent green = Strong bullish flow
- [ ] Consistent red = Strong bearish flow
- [ ] Flipping colors = Uncertain, wait for clarity

## 🚫 Invalidation Criteria (Exit Immediately)

- [ ] OBV makes new extreme against position
- [ ] Divergence fails (price continues in original direction)
- [ ] Flow ribbon flips against position
- [ ] Price structure breaks against trade
- [ ] Stop loss hit
