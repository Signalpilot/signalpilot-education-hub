# Market Regime Recognition Checklist

**From Lesson 22: The Volume Oracle - Stop Fighting the Market's Mood**

Use this checklist to identify market regime and adapt your strategy accordingly.

---

## üéØ What Is Market Regime?

**Regime** = The market's current "mood" or behavior pattern

- **Trending Regime**: Directional momentum, follow pullbacks
- **Ranging Regime**: Mean-reverting, fade extremes
- **Volatile Regime**: Whipsaw danger, reduce size or sit out

**The mistake:** Trading the same strategy in all regimes = guaranteed losses

---

## üìä Step 1: Identify Current Regime

### Check The Volume Oracle

- [ ] **Green (Trending Regime)**
  - Price making consistent directional progress
  - Follow the trend, buy pullbacks (uptrend) or sell rallies (downtrend)

- [ ] **Red (Ranging Regime)**
  - Price oscillating within boundaries
  - Fade extremes, sell resistance, buy support

- [ ] **Yellow (Transitioning)**
  - Regime uncertain, volatility increasing
  - Reduce position size, wait for clarity

---

## üîç Step 2: Confirm with Price Action

### Trending Regime Characteristics:

- [ ] Higher highs and higher lows (uptrend)
- [ ] Lower highs and lower lows (downtrend)
- [ ] Price respects moving averages as dynamic support/resistance
- [ ] Pullbacks are shallow (20-38% retracement)
- [ ] Breakouts continue in trend direction

### Ranging Regime Characteristics:

- [ ] Price bounces between clear support/resistance
- [ ] No sustained directional movement
- [ ] Breakout attempts fail and reverse
- [ ] Moving averages are flat or choppy
- [ ] Volume decreases at extremes

### Volatile Regime Characteristics:

- [ ] Large sudden moves in both directions
- [ ] ATR expanding rapidly
- [ ] News/event-driven price action
- [ ] Support/resistance levels breaking easily
- [ ] Unpredictable reversals

---

## üìã Step 3: Match Strategy to Regime

### If TRENDING (The Volume Oracle = Green):

**DO:**
- [ ] Trade in direction of trend
- [ ] Buy pullbacks to support (uptrend)
- [ ] Sell rallies to resistance (downtrend)
- [ ] Use wider stops (1.5-2√ó ATR)
- [ ] Let winners run (trail stops)
- [ ] Enter on Pentarch IGN/RUN events

**DON'T:**
- [ ] Fade the trend (counter-trend trades)
- [ ] Take profit too early
- [ ] Use tight stops (will get shaken out)
- [ ] Trade range strategies

**Reliability:** Highly reliable in trending conditions

---

### If RANGING (The Volume Oracle = Red):

**DO:**
- [ ] Fade extremes (sell resistance, buy support)
- [ ] Take profit quickly (ranges compress R:R)
- [ ] Use tighter stops (0.5-1√ó ATR)
- [ ] Scale out aggressively
- [ ] Wait for sweep + reversal signals

**DON'T:**
- [ ] Chase breakouts (most fail in ranges)
- [ ] Hold for large moves (won't happen)
- [ ] Use wide stops (unnecessary)
- [ ] Trade trend-following strategies

**Reliability:** Moderately reliable in ranging conditions

---

### If VOLATILE (The Volume Oracle = Yellow or Whipsawing):

**DO:**
- [ ] Reduce position size by 50%
- [ ] Wait for regime clarity
- [ ] Use wider stops if trading
- [ ] Be patient, don't force trades
- [ ] Watch for regime transition signals

**DON'T:**
- [ ] Trade full size (volatility will hurt)
- [ ] Get impatient and chase
- [ ] Overtrade to "make up for lost time"
- [ ] Ignore the regime change

**Reliability:** Low probability (skip if possible)

## üéØ Step 4: Regime Transition Detection

### Watch for These Warning Signs:

**Trending ‚Üí Ranging:**
- [ ] Breakout attempts start failing
- [ ] Pullbacks get deeper (50%+ retracements)
- [ ] Price starts oscillating around MA
- [ ] Volume decreases
- [ ] The Volume Oracle turns red

**Action:** Exit trend-following trades, prepare range strategies

---

**Ranging ‚Üí Trending:**
- [ ] Breakout holds and continues
- [ ] Volume increases on breakout
- [ ] Price makes new highs/lows with momentum
- [ ] Moving averages start sloping
- [ ] The Volume Oracle turns green

**Action:** Exit range trades, prepare trend-following strategies

---

**Any ‚Üí Volatile:**
- [ ] ATR spikes suddenly (>50% increase)
- [ ] News event or market shock
- [ ] Large gaps or fast moves
- [ ] Support/resistance levels breaking rapidly
- [ ] The Volume Oracle shows yellow or rapid color changes

**Action:** Reduce size immediately, tighten stops, consider cash
