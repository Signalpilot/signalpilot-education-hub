## 📊 Income vs. Capital Requirements

### Capital Needed for Target Income
| Monthly Income Goal | Required Return | Capital Needed |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| $2,000 (side income) | 10% | $20,000 |
| $5,000 (part-time) | 10% | $50,000 |
| $10,000 (full-time) | 8% | $125,000 |
| $20,000 (comfortable) | 8% | $250,000 |
| $50,000 (high income) | 5% | $1,000,000 |

### Reality Check
- [ ] **$100K+ capital needed for full-time** (at 8-10% monthly)
- [ ] **Returns compress as capital grows** (10% on $10K easier than 10% on $500K)
- [ ] **Plan for variability** (some months negative, some +20%)
- [ ] **Taxes reduce net** (40% to taxes = $20K gross = $12K net)

## 💡 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Quitting Job Too Early
- [ ] **Mistake:** 3 good months → quit job → pressure → blow account
- [ ] **Reality:** Need 12-24 months consistency BEFORE quitting
- [ ] **Safe approach:**
  1. Trade part-time (2-3 years)
  2. Build capital ($100K+)
  3. Prove consistency (12+ months green)
  4. Save 12 months expenses
  5. THEN quit job

### Pitfall 2: Overleveraging Small Accounts
- [ ] **Mistake:** $5K account, risk 10%/trade to "grow faster"
- [ ] **Result:** 3 losses = -30% = $3.5K left (hard to recover)
- [ ] **Correct:** Risk 2% max, focus on skill-building (not account growth)

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Taxes & Expenses
- [ ] **Mistake:** "I made $100K trading!" (gross, not net)
- [ ] **Reality:** $100K - 40% taxes - $5K software - $3K commissions = $57K net (43% gone)
- [ ] **Plan:** Set aside 40% for taxes quarterly

## 📊 Success Factors (Top 5 Traits)

### What Separates Winners from Losers
- [ ] **Discipline:** Follow plan (no FOMO, no revenge)
- [ ] **Patience:** Wait for A-grade setups (quality > quantity)
- [ ] **Risk management:** Never risk > 2% (survive to compound)

- [ ] **Continuous learning:** Journal, review, improve (never stop)

### The 90/90/90 Rule
- **90% of traders lose 90% of capital in 90 days**
- **Why most fail:**
  1. Overleveraging (risk > 5%)
  2. No plan (random entries)
  3. No risk management (no stops)
  4. Emotional trading (revenge, FOMO)
  5. Insufficient capital (can't withstand drawdowns)

### How to Join the 10%
- [ ] Risk 1-2% max per trade
- [ ] Written trading plan (entry/exit rules)
- [ ] Always use stops (never hope)
- [ ] Journal trades (learn from mistakes)
- [ ] Start with $10K+ (adequate capital)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Career Path Mastery
- **3-7 years realistic to full-time** (not 6 months)
- **Capital matters more than skill** (10% on $10K = $1K, 5% on $500K = $25K)
- **Track record = currency** (3 years green = credibility for prop/hedge fund)
- **Alternative paths exist** (prop, educator, quant = don't force solo trading)

### Monthly Milestones to Track
- [ ] Win rate (target 55-65%)
- [ ] Average R-multiple (target 2.0+)
- [ ] Sharpe ratio (target 1.5+)
- [ ] Max drawdown (target < 15%)
- [ ] Capital growth (deposits + compounding)

### Next Steps by Stage
- **Beginner:** Paper trade 3 months → Go live with $5K
- **Consistent:** Build to $50K → Refine edge → 6 green months
- **Advanced:** Scale to $100K-$250K → Professional setup → 12 green months
- **Full-time:** Quit job with $250K+ → 24 months track record → Safety net in place
