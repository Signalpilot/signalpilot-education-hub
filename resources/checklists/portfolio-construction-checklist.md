## 📋 Pre-Trade: Portfolio Assessment

### Step 1: Calculate Current Portfolio Heat

**List all open positions:**

| Position | Asset | Risk $ | Risk % |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | ________ | $________ | ____% |
| 2 | ________ | $________ | ____% |
| 3 | ________ | $________ | ____% |
| 4 | ________ | $________ | ____% |

- [ ] **Total portfolio heat:** ____% (sum of all risk %)
- [ ] Heat < 6-8%? Yes / No
- [ ] If > 8%: MUST close a position or wait

### Step 2: Check Correlation

**Asset class breakdown:**
- [ ] Equities (stocks, ETFs): ____% of portfolio
- [ ] Crypto (BTC, ETH, alts): ____% of portfolio
- [ ] Forex (currency pairs): ____% of portfolio
- [ ] Commodities (gold, oil): ____% of portfolio

**Sector exposure (if equities):**
- [ ] Tech: ____% (max 30-40%)
- [ ] Energy: ____% (max 30-40%)
- [ ] Finance: ____% (max 30-40%)
- [ ] Healthcare: ____% (max 30-40%)
- [ ] Other: ____% (max 30-40%)

**Correlation check:**
- [ ] Are 3+ positions in same sector? Yes / No (If Yes: Over-concentrated)
- [ ] Do positions move together? Yes / No (If Yes: High correlation risk)
- [ ] All positions same direction (all long or all short)? Yes / No (If Yes: Directional risk)

## ✅ New Position Checklist

**Before adding new position:**
- [ ] Current heat + new position = ____% (must be < 8%)
- [ ] New position sector: ________ (already > 40% in this sector? Yes / No)
- [ ] New position correlated to existing? Yes / No (Check 30-day chart comparison)
- [ ] Account drawdown < 15%? Yes / No (If > 15%: Reduce size)

**Position sizing:**
- [ ] Setup grade: A / B / C
- [ ] Risk allocation:
  - A-grade: 2% max
  - B-grade: 1% max
  - C-grade: Skip
- [ ] Calculated position size: ________ shares/contracts
- [ ] Risk $: $________ (= ____% of account)

## 🎯 Portfolio Allocation Framework

### Target Allocation (Example):
- [ ] Equities: 30-40% (diversified across sectors)
- [ ] Crypto: 20-30% (BTC, ETH primarily)
- [ ] Forex: 15-25% (2-3 uncorrelated pairs)
- [ ] Commodities: 10-20% (gold, oil)

### Position Limits:
- [ ] Max A-grade positions: 2-3 (total 4-6% heat)
- [ ] Max B-grade positions: 3-4 (total 3-4% heat)
- [ ] Total positions: 5-7 max (quality > quantity)

## 🔍 Sector Diversification Check

**Current sector exposure:**
- [ ] Largest sector: ________ = ____% (max 40%)
- [ ] Second largest: ________ = ____% (max 40%)
- [ ] Third largest: ________ = ____% (max 40%)

**If any sector > 40%:**
- [ ] Close weakest position in over-concentrated sector
- [ ] Or wait for position to close before adding to same sector
- [ ] Diversify into uncorrelated sector

## 🚨 Risk Triggers & Responses

### Daily Loss Limit:
- [ ] Account equity start of day: $________
- [ ] Max daily loss: 3% = $________
- [ ] Current daily P&L: $________
- [ ] If down 3%: Close all positions, done for day ✓

### Portfolio Heat Limit:
- [ ] Current total heat: ____%
- [ ] If > 8%: Close lowest-conviction position
- [ ] Reduced to: ____% ✓

### Drawdown Protocol:
- [ ] Peak account equity: $________
- [ ] Current equity: $________
- [ ] Drawdown: ____% = ($________ - $________) / $________

**Drawdown response:**
- [ ] 0-10%: Normal (no change)
- [ ] 10-15%: Caution (reduce size 25%, review trades)
- [ ] 15-20%: Warning (reduce size 50%, only A-grade setups)
- [ ] 20-25%: Critical (reduce size 75% or stop trading)
- [ ] > 25%: Shutdown (stop trading, full strategy review)

**If drawdown > 15%:**
- [ ] Reduced position size to: ____% of normal
- [ ] Only trading A-grade setups? ✓
- [ ] Trading journal reviewed for patterns? ✓

## 🔄 Rebalancing Triggers

**Rebalance when:**
- [ ] Position hits target (close, free up capital)

- [ ] Sector > 40% (close weakest in sector)
- [ ] Heat > 8% (close lowest-conviction position)

**Weekly rebalancing (Sunday evening):**
- [ ] Review all open positions
- [ ] Check sector allocation
- [ ] Verify correlation < 0.5 between positions
- [ ] Update target sectors for next week
