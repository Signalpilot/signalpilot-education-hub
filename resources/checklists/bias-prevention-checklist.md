## 📋 Pre-Trade: Red Team Exercise (Attack Your Thesis)

**Step 1: State Your Bias**
- [ ] I am: ☐ BULLISH ☐ BEARISH
- [ ] Trade direction: ________ (long / short)
- [ ] Primary reason for this trade: ________________________________________________

**Step 2: Bull Case (Why You Want This Trade)**
- [ ] List 3 specific reasons why this trade will work:
  1. ________________________________________________
  2. ________________________________________________
  3. ________________________________________________

**Step 3: Bear Case (Why You Should NOT Take This Trade)**
- [ ] List 3 specific counter-arguments (FORCE yourself to find opposing evidence):
  1. ________________________________________________
  2. ________________________________________________
  3. ________________________________________________

**Step 4: Invalidation Point**
- [ ] At what specific price or condition is your thesis DEAD?
  - Price level: $________ OR Condition: ________________
  - If this happens, thesis is wrong → EXIT IMMEDIATELY

**Step 5: Can You Refute the Bear Case?**
- [ ] Review the 3 bear case arguments above
- [ ] Can you provide solid evidence that refutes each one?
- [ ] YES (for all 3) = ✅ Trade has merit, proceed
- [ ] NO (for any) = ❌ Bear case is stronger, SKIP TRADE

## ✅ Objectivity Checks (All Must Be Met)

- [ ] **Echo Chamber Check**
  - Have I read OPPOSITE views today? (bulls if I'm bearish, bears if I'm bullish)
  - Am I following traders with opposing biases?
  - YES to both = ✅ Good | NO to either = ❌ Echo chamber risk

- [ ] **Selective Memory Check**
  - Am I remembering wins more than losses from this pattern?
  - Have I tracked actual expectancy (not just "feeling")?
  - Tracked objectively = ✅ Good | Just "feeling" = ❌ Bias risk

- [ ] **"This Time Is Different" Check**
  - Am I making an exception to my rules for this setup?
  - Am I telling myself "this one is special"?
  - NO exceptions = ✅ Good | Making exceptions = ❌ Rationalization bias

- [ ] **Hindsight Bias Check**
  - Did I pre-document my thesis BEFORE the trade?
  - Or am I retrofitting the story after seeing the chart?
  - Pre-documented = ✅ Good | Retrofitting = ❌ Hindsight bias

## 🎯 Pre-Trade Documentation (Write This Down)

**Document BEFORE entering trade:**

**My thesis (one sentence):**
- ________________________________________________

**Bull case (3 reasons):**
1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________
3. ________________________________________________

**Bear case (3 counter-arguments):**
1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________
3. ________________________________________________

**Invalidation point:**
- Price: $________ or Condition: ________________

**Can I refute the bear case?**
- ☐ YES (proceed with trade)
- ☐ NO (skip trade, bear case too strong)

**Date/Time:** ________________

## 🚫 Confirmation Bias Red Flags (Skip Trade if ANY Apply)

- [ ] Can't articulate the bear case (don't understand opposing view)
- [ ] Everyone in my feed/Discord agrees with me (echo chamber)
- [ ] Making exception to rules ("this setup is different")
- [ ] Can't refute even ONE bear case argument (thesis weak)
- [ ] Feeling 100% certain (overconfidence = blind spot)
- [ ] Haven't tracked actual expectancy for this pattern (trading on "feeling")

## 📊 Post-Trade: Bias Audit

**After trade closes, review:**

**Which view was correct?**
- ☐ Bull case was right (my original view)
- ☐ Bear case was right (opposing view I should have listened to)

**What did I miss?**
- Evidence I ignored: ________________________________________________
- Opposing signals I dismissed: ________________________________________________

**Pattern tracking:**
- How often am I right vs. wrong with this bias?
- Bull bias accuracy: ____ / 10 trades
- Bear bias accuracy: ____ / 10 trades

**Monthly Review:**
- Am I consistently ignoring opposing views?
- Which bias am I blind to (bullish or bearish)?
- What's my actual win rate when I refute bear case vs. when I can't?

**Remember:**
- ✅ Confirmation bias = seeing only what confirms your beliefs
- ✅ Creates false edges (you think 80%, reality is 30%)
- ✅ Echo chambers amplify bias (diversify information sources)
- ✅ Falsification mindset = seek to DISPROVE your thesis (not confirm it)
- ✅ Red Team exercise = attack your own trade before entering
- ✅ If you can't articulate bear case, you don't understand the trade
