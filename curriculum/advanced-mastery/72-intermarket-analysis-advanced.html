    <h4>💸 The $2.8B Fund That Missed the Intermarket Signal</h4>
    <p>In early 2022, a macro hedge fund was heavily long SPX (bullish tech) based on earnings growth and low volatility. They ignored intermarket warnings.</p>
    <p><strong>What they missed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>10Y Treasury yields:</strong> Broke out from 1.5% to 2.5% (Jan-Mar 2022) = major tightening signal</li>
      <li><strong>DXY (dollar):</strong> Rallied 5% in 8 weeks = risk-off + liquidity drain</li>
      <li><strong>Credit spreads (HYG/TLT):</strong> Widening for 12 weeks straight = credit market stress</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> SPX crashed 18% (Jan-June 2022) while yields soared. Fund was down 22% by mid-year. <strong>Intermarket divergences warned 3 months in advance.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Equities are the LAST to move. Yields, credit, and dollar lead by weeks/months. Ignore them at your peril.</p>

    <h4>📉 CASE STUDY: Marcus's $247K Intermarket Blindness (2022 Bear Market)</h4>
    <p><strong>Trader:</strong> Marcus Chen, 4-year SPX trader ($680,000 account, Mar 2022)</p>
    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Buy-the-dip on SPX using technical patterns (support/resistance, RSI oversold)</p>
    <p><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> Complete ignorance of intermarket signals (bonds, dollar, credit, commodities)</p>
    <p><strong>Period:</strong> March 29 - August 15, 2022 (20 weeks of pain)</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> -$247,000 (-36.3%) across 12 failed trades, ignoring every intermarket warning</p>

  <h3>The Disaster Timeline: How Ignoring Intermarket Signals Destroyed Marcus</h3>

  <div class="example-block">
    <h4>Background: The Setup (January - March 2022)</h4>
    <p>Marcus had made solid returns in 2020-2021 buying SPX dips during the Fed's QE era. Every dip got bought, every pullback recovered within weeks. His playbook was simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wait for SPX to drop 3-5% from recent highs</li>
      <li>Check RSI for oversold (&lt;30)</li>
      <li>Buy near support levels</li>
      <li>Sell when RSI &gt;60 or resistance hit</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2021 Results:</strong> 63% win rate, +$184,000 profit. Marcus thought he had "mastered" SPX trading.</p>
    <p><strong>What Marcus NEVER checked:</strong> 10Y yields, DXY, HYG/TLT credit spreads, copper, VIX structure, EUR/USD</p>

    <h4>TRADE #1: March 29, 2022 - The First "Buy the Dip" Disaster</h4>

    <p><strong>Marcus's Analysis (SPX Chart Only):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>SPX: $4,575 (down 5% from highs = "oversold")</li>
      <li>RSI: 28 (oversold territory)</li>
      <li>Support: $4,550 (previous resistance from Feb)</li>
      <li>Marcus: "Classic oversold bounce setup, buying here"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What Marcus IGNORED (Intermarket Warnings):</strong></p>
    <pre><code>MARCH 29, 2022 - INTERMARKET DASHBOARD MARCUS NEVER CHECKED:

10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD:
- Current: 2.34% (up from 1.51% on Jan 1)
- +83 basis points in 3 months = MASSIVE tightening
- Breaking above 2.30% resistance = more selling ahead
- Signal: BEARISH for equities (discount rate rising)

DXY (DOLLAR INDEX):
- Current: 98.6 (up from 95.6 on Jan 1)
- +3.1% rally = dollar strength hurting multinationals
- Breaking above 98 resistance = more upside
- Signal: BEARISH for SPX (earnings headwinds)

HYG/TLT RATIO (CREDIT SPREADS):
- Current: 0.442 (down from 0.465 on Jan 1)
- -4.9% decline = credit market pricing recession risk
- Breaking below 0.445 support = widening spreads
- Signal: BEARISH (credit ALWAYS leads equities)

COPPER:
- Current: $4.68/lb (down from $4.85 in Feb)
- -3.5% from recent highs = industrial demand weakening
- Below 50-day MA for first time in 6 months
- Signal: BEARISH (copper leads SPX by 1-3 months)

VIX STRUCTURE:
- VIX: 20.5
- VIX front month: 22.3 (higher than back months)
- Backwardation = market pricing SUSTAINED volatility
- Signal: BEARISH (contango = normal, backwardation = trouble)

EUR/USD:
- Current: 1.098 (down from 1.137 in Jan)
- -3.4% decline = dollar strength confirmed
- Breaking below 1.10 = more dollar upside
- Signal: BEARISH (strong USD hurts S&P earnings)

    <p><strong>What Marcus Still Didn't Understand:</strong></p>

    <h4>The Breaking Point: June 13, 2022</h4>

    <pre><code>MARCUS'S ACCOUNT STATUS:
Starting balance (March 29): $680,000
After 5 failed trades: $282,500
Total losses: -$397,500 (-58.5%)

MARCUS'S EMOTIONAL STATE:
- Depressed, can't sleep
- Checking SPX price 50+ times per day
- Blaming "rigged market" and Fed
- Wife threatening divorce over losses
- Considering quitting trading entirely

THE WAKE-UP CALL:
Marcus's friend David (macro trader) sees his trading journal.

David: "Marcus, you know yields went from 1.5% to 3.5% and you
       kept buying growth stocks? Did you even CHECK the dollar?"

Marcus: "I trade SPX, not bonds. Why would I check yields?"

David: "Because SPX is a DERIVATIVE of yields, credit, and dollar.
       You're flying blind. Every single one of your 'dips' happened
       during yield SPIKES. That's not buying the dip, that's
       catching a falling knife in a bear market."

Marcus: "But RSI was oversold every time..."

David: "RSI means NOTHING when the macro regime changes. You're
       using 2021 bull market tactics in a 2022 BEAR MARKET.
       The intermarket indicators told you this 3 months ago."
</code></pre>

    <p><strong>David's Intervention:</strong></p>
    <p>David spent 4 hours teaching Marcus intermarket analysis. He showed him:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How 10Y yields spiking = discount rate rising = growth stocks must compress</li>
      <li>How HYG/TLT ratio led SPX down by 3-4 weeks EVERY TIME</li>
      <li>How DXY breaking out = multinationals getting hit on currency translation</li>
      <li>How VIX backwardation = NOT a "buying opportunity" but sustained volatility regime</li>
      <li>How copper falling = industrial demand weakening = recession risk rising</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The New Framework David Gave Marcus:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>INTERMARKET CHECKLIST (BEFORE EVERY SPX TRADE):

1. 10-YEAR YIELD:
   ✓ Trend: Rising or falling?
   ✓ Pace: Slow grind or violent spike?
   ✓ Level: Above/below 3%? (growth stock headwind threshold)
   → If yields SPIKING: DO NOT BUY GROWTH/SPX

2. DXY (DOLLAR):
   ✓ Trend: Breaking out or breaking down?
   ✓ Level: Above/below 100? (strong dollar threshold)
   ✓ Correlation: SPX inverse to DXY lately?
   → If DXY RALLYING: WAIT for reversal before SPX long

3. HYG/TLT (CREDIT SPREADS):
   ✓ Trend: Ratio rising (spreads tightening) or falling (widening)?
   ✓ Divergence: HYG vs SPX moving together or diverging?
   ✓ Warning: If HYG falling while SPX flat = SELL SIGNAL
   → If CREDIT SPREADS WIDENING: Reduce equity exposure

4. COPPER:
   ✓ Trend: Above or below 50-day MA?
   ✓ Leading: Copper potential breakout while SPX lagging = BUY SIGNAL
   ✓ Warning: Copper potential breakdown = recession risk
   → If COPPER FALLING: Avoid cyclicals, reduce beta

5. VIX STRUCTURE:
   ✓ Contango or backwardation?
   ✓ Level: VIX above/below 20?
   → If BACKWARDATION: Volatility regime = reduce size

6. EUR/USD:
   ✓ Trend: Rising (dollar weak) or falling (dollar strong)?
   ✓ Risk-on/off: EUR/USD up = risk-on, down = risk-off
   → If EUR/USD FALLING: Risk-off environment

TRADING RULE:
- If 4+ indicators BEARISH: NO LONGS (only shorts or cash)
- If 4+ indicators BULLISH: Aggressive longs
- If MIXED (3 bull, 3 bear): Small size or wait

    <h4>The Recovery: Marcus Rebuilds with Intermarket Framework (July-December 2022)</h4>

    <p><strong>New Approach:</strong> Marcus stopped trading for 3 weeks (June 15 - July 7) to build his intermarket dashboard and backtest the framework.</p>

    <p><strong>Backtest Results (January-June 2022 Period):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Checked intermarket indicators for every one of his 5 failed trades</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> 4+ bearish indicators on EVERY SINGLE ENTRY</li>
      <li>If he had waited for 4+ bullish indicators: 0 trades taken (correct, it was a bear market)</li>
      <li>The framework would have kept him in CASH or SHORTS = saved $397K</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>First Trade with New Framework: July 14, 2022</strong></p>
    <pre><code>INTERMARKET ANALYSIS (JULY 14, 2022):

SPX: 3,863 (near June lows of 3,666)

1. 10-YEAR YIELD: 2.93% (down from 3.48% peak on June 14)
   → Falling (-55bp in 4 weeks) = BULLISH ✓

2. DXY: 107.8 → 106.2 (down -1.5% from July 1 peak)
   → Breaking down from highs = BULLISH ✓

3. HYG/TLT: 0.418 → 0.428 (+2.4% in 2 weeks)
   → Credit spreads TIGHTENING = BULLISH ✓

4. COPPER: $3.38/lb, bouncing from $3.15 low
   → Above 20-day MA, forming higher low = BULLISH ✓

5. VIX: 25.5, front month premium shrinking
   → Moving toward contango (normal) = BULLISH ✓

6. EUR/USD: 1.006 → 1.018 (+1.2%)
   → Dollar weakening, euro strengthening = BULLISH ✓

SCORE: 6 out of 6 BULLISH indicators
DECISION: First SPX long in 3.5 months

    <ul>
      <li>Marcus WAITED for intermarket alignment (6/6 bullish) instead of buying random "dips"</li>
      <li>He EXITED when conditions deteriorated (&lt;4 bullish) instead of "hoping for bounce"</li>
      <li>He used intermarket framework as FILTER, not just SPX chart</li>

    <h4>✅ What Marcus Learned (The Hard Way)</h4>
    <p><strong>Cost of lesson:</strong> $247,000 in losses (net after recovery: -$167K)</p>
    <p><strong>Time to learn:</strong> 6 months of pain, 6 months of recovery</p>
    <p><strong>Key realizations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>"SPX doesn't trade in a vacuum"</strong> - It's driven by yields, dollar, credit, commodities</li>
      <li><strong>"Equities are the LAST to move"</strong> - Yields, credit, dollar lead by weeks/months</li>
      <li><strong>"RSI oversold means nothing if macro is bearish"</strong> - Regime &gt; technicals</li>
      <li><strong>"The best trade is the one you don't take"</strong> - Framework kept him out of 3 losing trades</li>
      <li><strong>"Intermarket divergences are LEADING indicators"</strong> - HYG falling while SPX rising = sell signal</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Marcus's advice to other traders:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>"I thought I was a 'SPX trader' but I was really just gambling on price action. Now I'm an INTERMARKET trader who happens to trade SPX. The difference? I wait for the macro to CONFIRM the setup instead of fighting it. My win rate went from 0% to 100% just by adding a 6-point checklist. If you're not checking yields, credit, and the dollar before EVERY trade, you're flying blind."</blockquote>

<h2 id="part-1-the-intermarket-causality-chain">Part 1: The Intermarket Causality Chain</h2>

  <h3>How Assets Drive Each Other</h3>
  <p><strong>Primary driver → Secondary effect → Equity impact</strong></p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Example Chain:</strong> Fed cuts rates → Dollar weakens → Commodities rally → Inflation expectations rise → Growth stocks underperform (higher discount rate)</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Key Causality Chains</h3>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Chain #1: Dollar → Commodities → Inflation → Equities</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dollar falls (DXY down) → Commodities priced in USD rise (oil, copper, gold)</li>
        <li>Commodity prices rise → Input costs increase → Inflation accelerates</li>
        <li>Inflation rises → Fed tightens → Equity valuations compress</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Leading indicator:</strong> DXY breaking support → expect commodity rally in 2-4 weeks → inflation data confirms in 1-2 months → equity pressure follows</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> If DXY breaks down, rotate OUT of long-duration tech (ARKK, QQQ) INTO commodities (XLE, XLB)</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Chain #2: Credit Spreads → Risk Appetite → Equities</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High-yield spreads (HYG vs TLT) widen → Credit markets pricing in recession risk</li>
        <li>Credit tightening → Companies can't refinance debt cheaply → Defaults rise</li>
        <li>Risk-off → Equities sell off (credit leads equities by 1-3 months)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Leading indicator:</strong> HYG/TLT ratio breaking down → credit stress → SPX follows lower within weeks</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> If credit spreads widening while SPX making new highs → SELL SPX (divergence = warning)</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Chain #3: Yields → Growth vs Value → Sector Rotation</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>10-year yield rises → Discount rate for future earnings increases</li>
        <li>Growth stocks (high PE, distant cash flows) hurt more than value (low PE, near-term cash flows)</li>
        <li>Rotation: OUT of growth (QQQ, ARKK) INTO value (XLF, XLE, XLI)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Threshold:</strong> 10-year yield &gt; 4% historically triggers growth-to-value rotation</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> If 10Y breaking 4%, short QQQ / long XLF (relative value trade)</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h2 id="part-2-advanced-correlation-analysis">Part 2: Advanced Correlation Analysis</h2>

  <h3>Rolling Correlation (Dynamic Relationships)</h3>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Correlations are NOT static (SPX vs TLT correlation changes based on regime)</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Regime</th>
        <th>SPX vs TLT Correlation</th>
        <th>Interpretation</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Normal (2010-2019)</td>
        <td>-0.4 to -0.6 (inverse)</td>
        <td>Risk-on = stocks up, bonds down</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Crisis (2008, 2020)</td>
        <td>-0.8 to -0.9 (strong inverse)</td>
        <td>Flight to safety extreme</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>QE Environment (2020-2021)</td>
        <td>+0.2 to +0.4 (POSITIVE!)</td>
        <td>Fed buying both → both rise</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> When SPX and TLT BOTH rise (positive correlation) = Fed easing (bullish). When BOTH fall (correlation still positive but negative direction) = forced liquidation (panic).</p>

  <h3>Lead-Lag Relationships</h3>
  <p><strong>Concept:</strong> One asset leads, another follows (with time lag)</p>

  <p><strong>Example: Copper leads equities by 1-3 months</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copper rises → Industrial demand strong → Global growth accelerating</li>
    <li>Equities rally 1-3 months later as earnings reflect stronger economy</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Trade:</strong> If copper breaks out (new 6-month high) while SPX flat → expect SPX to follow higher (buy early, before crowd notices)</p>

  <div class="example-block">
    <h4>Real-World Example: Copper Leading SPX Rally (2023)</h4>
    <p><strong>Setup:</strong> October 2023 - Copper breaks out while equities lag</p>

    <p><strong>The Intermarket Chain That Predicted the Rally:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Oct 3 - Dollar Peaks:</strong> DXY hits 106.8 (overbought, RSI 72), starts rolling over</li>
      <li><strong>Oct 5 - Copper Bottoms:</strong> Copper $3.55 finds support at 200-day MA, starts rallying</li>
      <li><strong>Oct 27 - Key Divergence:</strong> Copper +3.7% while SPX still falling -3.3% (leading indicator!)</li>
      <li><strong>Oct 31 - Yields Peak:</strong> 10Y hits 4.93%, then reverses on weak jobs data</li>
      <li><strong>Nov 1 - Fed Pivot Signal:</strong> Fed hints at no more hikes → dollar falls, bonds rally</li>
      <li><strong>Nov 15 - SPX Catches Up:</strong> SPX finally rallies +3.7%, copper continues higher</li>
      <li><strong>Dec-Jan - Full Risk-On:</strong> Dollar -4%, yields -88bp, copper +9.3%, SPX +10.3%</li>

    <p><strong>The Trade (If You Caught Intermarket Signals):</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Trade Results:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entry avg:</strong> SPX 4,178 (blend of Oct 30 and Nov 3)</li>
      <li><strong>Exit:</strong> SPX 4,697</li>
      <li><strong>Gain:</strong> +519 points (+12.4%)</li>
      <li><strong>Holding period:</strong> 10 weeks</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Stop at 3,950 (Oct lows) = -228 points (-5.5%)</li>
      <li><strong>R:R:</strong> 519 / 228 = 2.3:1</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why Intermarket Analysis Worked:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Copper led by 3 weeks:</strong> Gave early signal before SPX bottomed</li>
      <li><strong>Dollar reversal confirmed:</strong> DXY -4% = commodity rally + EM strength</li>
      <li><strong>Yield peak confirmed:</strong> 10Y -88bp = growth stocks rally (QQQ +15% in same period)</li>
      <li><strong>Credit supported:</strong> HYG/TLT ratio rising = no credit stress</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> Waiting for SPX to "confirm" = missed first 3% of move. Copper + dollar + yields gave 3-week advance warning. <strong>Intermarket analysis = leading indicator, not lagging.</strong></p>

  <h2 id="part-3-intermarket-divergences-advanced-signals">Part 3: Intermarket Divergences (Advanced Signals)</h2>

  <h3>Divergence #1: Transports vs Industrials (Dow Theory)</h3>
  <p><strong>Theory:</strong> For rally to be valid, transports (DJT) must confirm industrials (DJI)</p>
  <p><strong>Divergence setup:</strong> DJI making new highs, DJT lagging (not confirming)</p>
  <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Goods being produced (industrials) but not shipped (transports) = fake rally, inventory build-up</p>
  <p><strong>Trade:</strong> Bearish divergence → reduce equity exposure, buy puts</p>

  <h3>Divergence #2: Small-Caps vs Large-Caps (IWM vs SPY)</h3>
  <p><strong>Theory:</strong> Small-caps lead at cycle turns (more sensitive to economic conditions)</p>
  <p><strong>Bullish divergence:</strong> IWM bottoms and rallies while SPY still falling → recession ending, risk appetite returning</p>
  <p><strong>Bearish divergence:</strong> SPY making new highs but IWM failing to confirm → late cycle, institutions reducing risk</p>

  <h3>Divergence #3: Regional Equity Markets</h3>
  <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Different regions lead/lag based on economic cycle</p>

  <h3>The Commodity Curve: Backwardation vs Contango</h3>

  <p><strong>Contango (normal):</strong> Future prices &gt; spot prices (storage costs priced in)</p>
  <p><strong>Backwardation (demand surge):</strong> Spot prices &gt; future prices (immediate shortage)</p>

  <p><strong>Trading implication:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oil in backwardation → Supply shortage, demand strong → Bullish for energy stocks (XLE)</li>
    <li>Oil in contango → Oversupply → Bearish for energy (avoid or short)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cross-Commodity Relationships</h3>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Gold vs Real Yields (Inverse Correlation)</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Real Yield = 10Y Nominal Yield - Inflation Expectations</p>
      <p><strong>Relationship:</strong> Real yields UP → Gold DOWN (opportunity cost of holding gold increases)</p>
      <p><strong>Real yields DOWN → Gold UP</strong> (negative real yields = gold becomes attractive)</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> If real yields break below -1%, buy gold (GLD, miners GDXJ)</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Copper/Gold Ratio (Growth Indicator)</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Ratio rising:</strong> Copper outperforming gold → Growth accelerating (copper = industrial demand, gold = safe haven)</p>
      <p><strong>Ratio falling:</strong> Gold outperforming copper → Growth slowing, defensive rotation</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> Copper/gold ratio breaking out → buy cyclicals (XLI, XLB), sell defensives (XLP, XLU)</p>

  <h2 id="part-5-currency-market-insights">Part 5: Currency Market Insights</h2>

  <h3>EUR/USD as Risk Barometer</h3>
  <p><strong>EUR/USD rising:</strong> Dollar weakness → Commodities rally, EM outperforms, SPX benefits (weaker USD = multinational earnings boost)</p>
  <p><strong>EUR/USD falling:</strong> Dollar strength → Commodities fall, EM underperforms, SPX headwinds</p>

  <h3>JPY as Safe Haven</h3>
  <p><strong>USD/JPY falling (JPY strengthening):</strong> Risk-off, flight to safety → SPX likely declining</p>
  <p><strong>USD/JPY rising (JPY weakening):</strong> Risk-on → SPX likely rallying</p>

  <h3>Carry Trade Unwind Detection</h3>
  <p><strong>Carry trade:</strong> Borrow in low-yield currency (JPY), invest in high-yield assets (equities, EM bonds)</p>
  <p><strong>Unwind signal:</strong> JPY suddenly strengthens + VIX spikes + EM currencies fall → Massive liquidation (2008, Aug 2015, March 2020)</p>
  <p><strong>Action:</strong> Exit all risk assets immediately (carry unwinds are violent and fast)</p>

  <h3>Janus Atlas: Multi-Asset Correlation View</h3>
  <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Overlay SPY, TLT, DXY, GLD, USO on single chart</p>
  <p><strong>Use case:</strong> Visual divergence detection (SPY up, HYG down = credit divergence)</p>

  <h3>Pentarch Pilot Line: Cross-Asset Flow</h3>
  <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Track institutional flow across equities, bonds, commodities</p>
  <p><strong>Signal:</strong> If institutional flow rotating OUT of equities INTO bonds → risk-off warning</p>

  <h3>Harmonic Oscillator: Intermarket Regime Classification</h3>
  <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Identify if assets in same regime (all trending vs all mean-reverting)</p>
  <p><strong>Alert:</strong> When correlation regime shifts (e.g., SPX/TLT goes from -0.6 to +0.3) = macro change</p>

  <div class="quiz">
    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q1:</strong> DXY breaks major support (dollar falling). What's your intermarket trade?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Long commodities (GLD, USO, COPX) and emerging markets (EEM). Weak dollar = commodities rally (priced in USD) + EM benefits (debt burden lightens). Consider rotating OUT of dollar-sensitive sectors into materials/energy.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q2:</strong> SPY making new highs but HYG (high-yield bonds) falling. What's happening?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Major divergence. Credit market smelling trouble (defaults rising, recession risk) while equity investors complacent. Credit ALWAYS leads equities. This is bearish signal—reduce equity exposure, buy puts. SPX will likely follow HYG lower within weeks.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Copper/gold ratio breaking out to new 6-month highs. What's the macro signal?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Growth reaccelerating. Copper (industrial demand) outperforming gold (safe haven) = risk-on, economic expansion. Buy cyclicals (XLI, XLB, XLE), rotate OUT of defensives (XLP, XLU). Small-caps (IWM) should also outperform.</p>
