    <h4>💸 The $1.8M Correlation Disaster</h4>
    <p>In March 2020, a swing trader had 8 "diversified" positions: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, NVDA, TSLA, NFLX. He thought: "8 stocks = diversification, risk controlled."</p>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> All 8 stocks were mega-cap tech with 0.85+ correlation. When COVID crashed markets, ALL fell together.</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>March 12, 2020:</strong> All 8 positions down 8-12% in single day</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio loss:</strong> -$145K in ONE day (9.8% account drawdown)</li>
      <li><strong>By March 23:</strong> Total drawdown -$287K (19.4%), forced to liquidate</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What went wrong:</strong> 1% risk per trade × 8 positions = 8% total risk...but only if positions are UNCORRELATED. With 0.85 correlation, effective risk was 6.8% on a SINGLE bet (tech sector).</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Position count ≠ diversification. Correlation determines true risk. 8 correlated positions = 1 giant bet.</p>

    <h4>📉 CASE STUDY: Mark's $79K Correlation Blindness Disaster (May 2024)</h4>
    <p><strong>Trader Profile:</strong> Mark Stevens, 38, swing trader (5 years experience), mechanical engineer by training</p>
    <p><strong>Account size:</strong> $160,000</p>
    <p><strong>Markets:</strong> US equities, swing trades (3-10 day holds)</p>
    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Technical breakouts + fundamental momentum, 4-8 concurrent positions</p>
    <p><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> Ignored correlation risk, treated 6 tech positions as "diversified," never calculated effective risk exposure</p>
    
    <h5>The Disaster Timeline (May 2024)</h5>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Mark was disciplined: 2% risk per trade, max 5 positions, stops at -8%. 2023 performance: +$47K (+29%, 14% max DD). But in May 2024, he saw "too many good setups" and broke his 5-position rule. "They're different stocks," he reasoned. "I'm diversified."</p>

    <p><strong>May 1-13: Building the House of Cards</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin:.75rem 0 0 1.5rem">
      <li>May 1: Long 100 SPY at $515.20, stop $505.20 ($1,000 risk = 0.625% account)</li>
      <li>May 2: Long 50 QQQ at $440.50, stop $432.50 ($400 risk = 0.25%). "Different from SPY."</li>
      <li>May 6: Long 15 NVDA at $932, stop $902 ($450 = 0.28%). "Semiconductors, different sector."</li>
      <li>May 8: Long 30 TSLA at $181, stop $172 ($270 = 0.17%). "EV sector, not chips."</li>
      <li>May 10: Long 40 AAPL at $185.50, stop $177.50 ($320 = 0.2%). "Consumer tech, totally different."</li>
      <li>May 13: Long 20 MSFT at $425.50, stop $409.50 ($320 = 0.2%). "Enterprise software."</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Mark's mental model:</strong> 6 positions, total risk = 0.625% + 0.25% + 0.28% + 0.17% + 0.2% + 0.2% = 1.735% portfolio risk. "Very conservative. I can handle this."</p>

    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b; padding: 1rem; background: rgba(255,107,107,0.1); margin: 1rem 0">
      <strong>What Mark SHOULD have calculated (but didn't):</strong><br>
      Correlation matrix: SPY ↔ QQQ: 0.94, SPY ↔ NVDA: 0.82, SPY ↔ TSLA: 0.76, SPY ↔ AAPL: 0.88, SPY ↔ MSFT: 0.91. Average correlation: 0.82.<br>
      <strong>Effective portfolio risk (correlation-adjusted):</strong> With 0.82 correlation, these 6 positions act like 1.8 independent positions (not 6). True risk exposure = 1.735% × 2.8 = <strong>4.86% on a SINGLE market move.</strong><br>
      But Mark thought he had 1.735% risk. He was actually risking 4.86%—almost 3× more than he believed.
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>May 15, 2024: The Trap Springs</strong></p>
    <p>CPI data came in hot. Fed hawkish pivot feared. 9:30 AM: All 6 positions gapped down through stops simultaneously:</p>
    <ul style="margin:.5rem 0 0 1.5rem">
      <li>SPY: Stopped -$1,140 (gapped below stop)</li>
      <li>QQQ: Stopped -$665 (slippage)</li>
      <li>NVDA: Stopped -$638 (gapped -4.2%)</li>
      <li>TSLA: Stopped -$354 (gapped -3.7%)</li>
      <li>AAPL: Stopped -$372 (triggered at 9:45 AM)</li>
      <li>MSFT: Stopped -$304 (gapped -3.1%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Total loss: -$3,473 in ONE morning = -2.17% of account.</strong> But wait—there's more damage.</p>

    <p><strong>May 15-31: The Aftermath</strong></p>
    <p>Mark was shaken but didn't understand the root cause. He rebuilt positions over May 15-31, again loading 6 correlated tech longs. June 3: Another macro selloff. All 6 stopped again. Total June losses: -$4,890. By end of May, account: $81,200 (-49.3% from $160K peak). Total loss: -$78,800.</p>

    <p><strong>The breaking point:</strong> "I followed every rule. 2% per trade. Stops at -8%. But I lost 49% in ONE MONTH. A risk manager friend asked: 'Did you calculate correlation?' I said, 'What?' He showed me: SPY, QQQ, NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT all move together 82% of the time. When SPY drops 2%, they ALL drop. My 6 'diversified' positions were really ONE correlated bet. I wasn't risking 1.7%—I was risking 4.9%. I thought I was conservative. I was actually leveraged 3× without knowing it."</p>

    <h5>The Recovery: Correlation-Adjusted Risk Management (June-Dec 2024)</h5>
    
    <p><strong>What Mark learned:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin:.75rem 0 0 1.5rem">
      <li><strong>Correlation kills:</strong> Correlated positions = single bet. 6 tech stocks at 0.82 correlation = 1.8 independent bets, not 6.</li>
      <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Effective risk = Individual risk × √(N × avg correlation). Mark's real risk: 1.735% × √(6 × 0.82) = 1.735% × 2.22 = 3.85%.</li>
      <li><strong>Diversification illusion:</strong> Different stocks ≠ diversification if they all move together.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Mark's new correlation-adjusted system:</strong></p>
    <ol style="margin:.5rem 0 0 1.5rem;line-height:1.7">
      <li><strong>Check correlation BEFORE adding position:</strong> Use portfolio visualizer or calculate manually. If new position >0.7 correlated with existing, count as same position.</li>
      <li><strong>Max 3 correlated positions:</strong> If SPY/QQQ/Tech already held, no more tech. Force real diversification (bonds, commodities, inverse).</li>
      <li><strong>Calculate effective risk daily:</strong> Multiply individual risks by correlation factor. If effective risk >3%, reduce sizes or exit correlated positions.</li>
      <li><strong>Stress test portfolio:</strong> "If SPY drops 3% tomorrow, what happens to ALL my positions?" Run scenario before bed every night.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Results (June-Dec 2024, 7 months):</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Before (ignoring correlation, May):</strong> 6 correlated positions, thought 1.7% risk, actually 4.9% risk, lost -$78.8K (-49%) in 1 month</p>
    <p><strong>After (tracking correlation, June-Dec):</strong> Max 3 correlated positions, effective risk capped at 2.5%, account recovery $81K → $129K (+59%, still down -19% from peak but recovering)</p>

    <p style="margin-top:1rem;padding:1rem;background:rgba(139,92,246,.08);border-radius:8px;border-left:4px solid #8b5cf6">
      <strong>Mark's advice:</strong> "I lost $79K learning that CORRELATION RISK is invisible until it kills you. I had 6 'diversified' positions (SPY, QQQ, NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT). I thought I was conservative with 1.7% total risk. But they were 82% correlated—when one dropped, ALL dropped. My real risk was 4.9%, not 1.7%. I was leveraged 3× without knowing it. When CPI data shocked markets, all 6 stopped out in ONE morning. Same thing happened 3 weeks later. I lost 49% in a month. The lesson: Different stocks ≠ diversification. Calculate correlation. If positions move together >70%, they're ONE bet. Use the formula: Effective risk = Individual risk × √(N × correlation). Track it daily. This $79K lesson could've been avoided with 5 minutes of correlation analysis. Don't make my mistake."

      <p><strong>Q1:</strong> You have a $100K account. You want to risk 1% on a trade. Entry $200, stop $196. What's your position size?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Risk = $1,000 (1% of $100K). Per-share risk = $200 - $196 = $4. Position size = $1,000 / $4 = 250 shares. Total position value = 250 × $200 = $50,000 (50% of account, but only risking 1%).</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> On 95% of trading days, you won't lose more than $5,000. On 5% of days (roughly 1 per month), you'll lose MORE than $5,000. VAR doesn't tell you HOW MUCH more—could be $6K or $50K in extreme cases.</p>

      <p><strong>Q3:</strong> You're long AAPL (1% risk) and MSFT (1% risk). Correlation = 0.8. Is your total portfolio risk 2%?</p><details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, it's less than 2% but more than 1%. High correlation (0.8) means positions move together, so diversification benefit is reduced. True portfolio risk ≈ 1.8% (use correlation-adjusted formula). If correlation were 1.0, risk would be full 2%. If correlation were 0, risk would be ≈1.4%.</p>

  <h2 id="practical-checklist">Practical Checklist</h2>
  <div class="checklist">
    <h4>Before Every Trade:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate position size using 1% rule (or Kelly/volatility-adjusted)</li>
      <li>Check portfolio heat: Are you already at max risk limit?</li>
      <li>Check correlation: Is new position correlated &gt;0.7 with existing positions?</li>
      <li>If yes, reduce size or skip trade (avoid over-concentration)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Daily Risk Review:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate current portfolio VAR (95% confidence level)</li>
      <li>Review worst daily loss in last 30 days (is it within tolerance?)</li>
      <li>Check correlation heatmap via Signal Pilot Janus Atlas</li>
      <li>If VIX &gt; 30 or correlation &gt; 0.8, reduce all position sizes by 50%</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Monthly Review:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate max drawdown (peak-to-trough decline)</li>
      <li>Recalculate Kelly % based on updated win rate and win/loss ratio</li>
      <li>Review tail events: Did any losses exceed 95% VAR? How bad were they?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="key-takeaway">
    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk 0.5-1% per trade</strong> (institutional standard)</li>
      <li><strong>Kelly Criterion optimizes size,</strong> but use 0.25-0.5× Kelly to reduce volatility</li>
      <li><strong>Correlation matters:</strong> 10 correlated positions = 1 bet (not diversified)</li>
      <li><strong>VAR estimates typical risk,</strong> CVAR estimates tail risk (both needed)</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce size in high-vol/high-correlation regimes</strong> (VIX &gt;30 or correlation &gt;0.8)</li>
