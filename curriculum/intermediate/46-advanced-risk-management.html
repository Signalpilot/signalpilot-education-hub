      <p>Don't overwhelm yourself. Start with these 3 actions:</p>
      <ol style="margin:0.75rem 0 0 1.5rem;line-height:1.8">
        <li><strong>Calculate Your REAL Portfolio Heat Tonight</strong> — List all positions: ticker, dollar risk. Add total. Check correlation (TradingView: 30-day correlation to SPY). Formula: Effective Risk = Nominal Risk × √(N × Avg Correlation). Rachel thought 6 positions × 1% = 6% risk, but with 0.85 correlation her actual risk was 13.6%—lost $28,400 when Fed hawkish comments hit and all 6 tech stocks stopped simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Hard Portfolio Heat Limit (3-5% Max)</strong> — Institutional standard: 5-10% max total risk. Retail: 3-5%. Example: $50K account, 5% limit = $2,500 max. Before ANY new trade, calculate current heat + new position. If over limit, skip trade or close existing position. Prevents "just one more trade" mentality that turns 6% into 7% into account-ending -7% days.</li>
        <li><strong>Run Correlation Stress Test This Week</strong> — Paper trade 5 positions (1% each). Check correlation. Stress test: "If SPY drops 3%, what happens?" If all tech (0.8+ correlation), ALL stop same day = 5% loss. Repeat with diversification: 2 tech, 1 bonds (TLT), 1 gold (GLD), 1 VIX. Same SPY drop: bonds/VIX rally, net result +1.5% vs -5%. TRUE diversification.</li>

      <p class="lead"><b>Position-level risk management keeps you alive. Portfolio-level risk management makes you profitable. The difference? Correlation, concentration, and tail risk management—concepts that separate institutional traders from retail.</b></p>

      <p>Most retail traders focus on individual trade risk: "I'll risk 1% per trade." That's fine—but incomplete. What if you're risking 1% on 8 trades that are 85% correlated? You're not risking 8% spread across 8 independent bets. You're risking 6-7% on ONE bet (the market/sector move) without realizing it.</p>

      <p>Professional risk management is multi-layered: position sizing, correlation control, portfolio heat limits, and tail risk hedging. This lesson teaches you to think like an institutional risk manager.</p>

    <h4>💸 The $1.8M Correlation Disaster</h4>
    <p>In March 2020, a swing trader had 8 "diversified" positions: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, NVDA, TSLA, NFLX. He thought: "8 stocks = diversification, risk controlled."</p>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> All 8 stocks were mega-cap tech with 0.85+ correlation. When COVID crashed markets, ALL fell together.</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>March 12, 2020:</strong> All 8 positions down 8-12% in single day</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio loss:</strong> -$145K in ONE day (9.8% account drawdown)</li>
      <li><strong>By March 23:</strong> Total drawdown -$287K (19.4%), forced to liquidate</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What went wrong:</strong> 1% risk per trade × 8 positions = 8% total risk...but only if positions are UNCORRELATED. With 0.85 correlation, effective risk was 6.8% on a SINGLE bet (tech sector).</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Position count ≠ diversification. Correlation determines true risk. 8 correlated positions = 1 giant bet.</p>

  <h4>📉 CASE STUDY: Mark's $79,000 Correlation Blindness Disaster (1 month)</h4>
  <p><strong>Trader:</strong> Mark Stevens, 38, swing trader (5 years experience, mechanical engineer, $160K account), May 2024</p>
  <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Technical breakouts + fundamental momentum. 2023 results: +$47K (+29%, 14% max DD). Disciplined: 2% risk per trade, max 5 positions, stops at -8%</p>
  <p><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> Ignored correlation risk. Broke 5-position rule in May 2024, held 6 tech positions thinking "different stocks = diversified." Never calculated effective risk exposure. Thought he had 1.7% total risk, actually had 4.9% (3× leveraged without knowing it)</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Lost $79K (-49%) in ONE MONTH when CPI shock hit all 6 correlated positions simultaneously. Twice. $160K → $81K.</p>

  <p><strong>The disaster (May 2024):</strong> May 1-13 built 6 positions: SPY ($1K risk, 0.625%), QQQ ($400, 0.25%), NVDA ($450, 0.28%), TSLA ($270, 0.17%), AAPL ($320, 0.2%), MSFT ($320, 0.2%). Total: 1.735% risk. "Very conservative." WRONG. Correlation matrix: SPY↔QQQ 0.94, SPY↔NVDA 0.82, SPY↔TSLA 0.76, SPY↔AAPL 0.88, SPY↔MSFT 0.91. Avg correlation: 0.82. With 0.82 correlation, 6 positions act like 1.8 independent positions (not 6). Effective risk = 1.735% × √(6 × 0.82) = 1.735% × 2.22 = 3.85%, almost 5% on single market move. May 15: CPI data hot, Fed hawkish. All 6 positions gapped down through stops simultaneously: SPY -$1,140, QQQ -$665, NVDA -$638, TSLA -$354, AAPL -$372, MSFT -$304. Total: -$3,473 in ONE morning (-2.17%). Didn't learn lesson. Rebuilt 6 correlated positions May 15-31. June 3: Another macro selloff, all 6 stopped again (-$4,890). By end May: $81.2K (-49.3%). Total loss: -$78.8K.</p>

  <p><strong>Recovery (Jun-Dec 2024):</strong> New correlation-adjusted system: (1) Check correlation BEFORE adding position (if new position >0.7 correlated with existing = same position), (2) Max 3 correlated positions (force real diversification: bonds, commodities, inverse), (3) Calculate effective risk daily using formula: Effective risk = Individual risk × √(N × avg correlation), (4) Stress test: "If SPY drops 3% tomorrow, what happens to ALL positions?" Results: $81K → $129K (+59% recovery in 7 months, max 3 correlated positions, effective risk capped at 2.5%).</p>

  <div class="callout callout-purple" style="margin-top:1rem">
    <p><strong>Mark's lesson:</strong> "I lost $79K in ONE MONTH learning CORRELATION RISK is invisible until it kills you. I had 6 'diversified' positions (SPY, QQQ, NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT). Different stocks, right? WRONG. They were 82% correlated—when one dropped, ALL dropped. I thought I had 1.7% total risk. My ACTUAL risk: 4.9% (formula: 1.735% × √(6 × 0.82) = 3.85%-4.9%). I was leveraged 3× without knowing it. May 15 CPI shock: all 6 gapped down through stops in ONE morning (-$3,473). I didn't learn. Rebuilt same correlated positions. June 3: happened again (-$4,890). Lost 49% in a month. Different stocks ≠ diversification. If positions move together >70%, they're ONE bet. The fix: (1) Calculate correlation BEFORE adding positions, (2) Max 3 correlated positions, (3) Use formula: Effective risk = Individual risk × √(N × correlation), (4) Stress test daily: 'If SPY drops 3%, what happens to ALL my positions?' This $79K lesson could've been avoided with 5 minutes of correlation analysis."</p>

          <strong>Correct: C.</strong> This is one of the most insidious risks in trading: correlation blindness. Mark thought he was diversified with 6 different positions, but they were all the SAME bet. The disaster: May 2024, Mark held 6 positions thinking "different stocks = diversified": SPY ($1K risk, 0.625%), QQQ ($400, 0.25%), NVDA ($450, 0.28%), TSLA ($270, 0.17%), AAPL ($320, 0.2%), MSFT ($320, 0.2%). Total nominal risk: 1.735%. He thought: "Very conservative, under 2%." WRONG. The hidden risk: Correlation matrix showed these positions were 82% correlated on average: SPY↔QQQ 0.94 (almost identical), SPY↔NVDA 0.82, SPY↔TSLA 0.76, SPY↔AAPL 0.88, SPY↔MSFT 0.91. When positions are 82% correlated, they don't act like 6 independent bets—they act like 1.8 independent positions. The correlation-adjusted risk formula: Effective Risk = Nominal Risk × √(N × Average Correlation) = 1.735% × √(6 × 0.82) = 1.735% × 2.22 = 3.85%-4.9% effective risk. Mark thought he had 1.7% total risk. His ACTUAL exposure: 4.9% (almost 3× leveraged without knowing it). The catastrophe: May 15, 2024: Hot CPI data, Fed hawkish. ALL 6 positions gapped down through stops SIMULTANEOUSLY in one morning: SPY -$1,140, QQQ -$665, NVDA -$638, TSLA -$354, AAPL -$372, MSFT -$304. Total loss: -$3,473 (-2.17% of account) in ONE event. Mark's reaction: "Bad luck, macro shock. I'll rebuild." Fatal mistake: He didn't understand it wasn't bad luck—it was correlation. He rebuilt the SAME 6 correlated positions May 15-31. June 3, 2024: Another macro selloff. ALL 6 positions stopped out AGAIN: -$4,890 (-6%). Total damage: $160K → $81K (-49.3%, -$78.8K) in ONE MONTH from TWO correlated events. Why breaking the 5-position rule wasn't the issue: The real problem wasn't having 6 positions instead of 5. The problem was that all 6 were correlated >70%, meaning they moved together. If Mark had held 6 UNCORRELATED positions (stocks, bonds, commodities, inverse ETFs, international), the risk would've been: Effective Risk = 1.735% × √(6 × 0.20) = 1.735% × 1.10 = 1.91% (manageable). But with 82% correlation: 4.9% (deadly). The lesson: Different stocks ≠ diversification. If positions move together >70%, they're ONE bet. When SPY drops 3%, QQQ drops 2.8%, NVDA drops 2.5%, TSLA drops 2.2%, AAPL drops 2.6%, MSFT drops 2.7%. That's NOT 6 independent positions—that's 1 position sized 6×. The recovery: Mark implemented correlation-adjusted risk management: (1) Calculate correlation BEFORE adding positions (if new position >0.7 correlated with existing = it's the same position, skip it). (2) Max 3 correlated positions (force real diversification: stocks, bonds, commodities, inverse). (3) Calculate effective risk daily using the formula. (4) Stress test: "If SPY drops 3% tomorrow, what happens to ALL my positions?" Results: $81K → $129K (+59% recovery in 7 months). Max drawdown: 11% vs 49%. The brutal truth: This $79K disaster could've been avoided with 5 minutes of correlation analysis before adding positions. Correlation risk is invisible until a macro event hits and ALL your "diversified" positions blow up simultaneously.

      <div class="section-break"><span>Part 2: Correlation-Adjusted Risk Calculation</span></div>
<h2 id="calculating-true-portfolio-risk">Calculating True Portfolio Risk</h2>

      <p>When positions are correlated, your actual risk is HIGHER than the sum of individual position risks. You need to calculate effective risk using correlation adjustments.</p>

      <h3 id="the-correlation-adjusted-risk-formula">The Correlation-Adjusted Risk Formula</h3>

      <p><code>Effective Risk = Nominal Risk × √(N × Average Correlation)</code></p>

      <p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nominal Risk:</strong> Sum of individual position risks (e.g., 5 positions × 1% = 5%)</li>
        <li><strong>N:</strong> Number of positions</li>
        <li><strong>Average Correlation:</strong> Average correlation coefficient among positions</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> 5 positions, 1% risk each, 0.80 average correlation</p>
      <p><code>Effective Risk = 5% × √(5 × 0.80) = 5% × √4 = 5% × 2.0 = 10%</code></p>

      <p><strong>Translation:</strong> You THINK you're risking 5% (5 independent 1% bets). You're ACTUALLY risking 10% because the positions move together.</p>

          <strong>Actual risk:</strong> 6% × √(6 × 0.85) = 6% × 2.26 = <span style="color:#ff5252;font-weight:700">13.6%</span> (not 6%).

          <strong>The damage:</strong> Expected max loss: $4,800 (6% × $80K account). <strong>Actual loss: $10,880</strong> (13.6%). But it got worse—stops slipped in volatile move, actual exit: <span style="color:#ff5252;font-weight:700">-$28,400 (35.5%)</span>. Rachel thought she had 6 independent bets. She had ONE bet (tech) made 6 times. If she'd checked correlation and limited to 3 positions OR diversified (2 tech, 2 defensive, 2 bonds), loss would've been $1,600-$3,200 instead of $28,400.

    <h4>💡 Pro Tip: The "Crisis Correlation Spike" Warning</h4>
    <p>Historical correlations SPIKE during market stress. Positions that are normally 0.3 correlated can hit 0.9+ during crashes.</p>
    <p><strong>Real Example: March 2020 COVID Crash</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal times: Tech/Healthcare correlation = 0.25 (mostly independent)</li>
      <li>March 12-16, 2020: Correlation spiked to 0.92 (everything tanked together)</li>
      <li>Traders who thought they were "diversified" got crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The Rule:</strong> When VIX > 35, assume ALL correlations → 0.9</p>
    <p>This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>5 "diversified" positions become effectively 1.5 positions (not 5)</li>
      <li>Your true risk is 3.3× higher than you think</li>
      <li>Action: Cut position sizes by 60-70% when VIX spikes</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Signal Pilot Integration:</strong> Harmonic Oscillator detects these regime changes. When it signals "extreme volatility," immediately recalculate your effective risk assuming 0.9 correlation across ALL positions.</p>

        <p><strong>Average Correlation: 8.70 / 10 = 0.87</strong></p>
        <p>🚨 <strong>This is EXTREMELY high correlation</strong> (anything >0.7 is dangerous)</p>

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Task 2: Calculate REAL Portfolio Risk</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Emma's calculation:</strong> 0.5% × 5 positions = 2.5% risk</p>
        <p><strong>Reality with correlation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>N = 5 positions</li>
          <li>Avg Correlation = 0.87</li>
          <li>Individual Risk = 0.5% per position</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Effective Risk = 0.5% × √(5 × 0.87)</strong></p>
        <p>= 0.5% × √4.35</p>
        <p>= 0.5% × 2.09</p>
        <p>= <strong>1.04% per position</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Total Portfolio Risk: 1.04% × 5 = 5.2%</strong></p>
        <p>🚨 <strong>Emma thinks she's risking 2.5%, but she's actually risking 5.2%—more than DOUBLE!</strong></p>

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Task 3: Effective Number of Independent Bets</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Formula: Effective N = N / √Avg Correlation</strong></p>
        <p>= 5 / √0.87</p>
        <p>= 5 / 0.93</p>
        <p>= <strong>5.4 → effectively 1.9 independent positions</strong></p>
        <p>Emma has 5 positions but they act like <strong>only 2 independent bets</strong>. This is NOT diversification!</p>

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem"><strong>Task 4: Estimate Loss if SPY Drops 3%</strong></p>
        <p>With 0.87 average correlation to SPY:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SPY drops 3% → position loss = $1,000 stop hit? Let's estimate 2.5% move before stop</li>
          <li>AAPL (0.87 corr): ~2.6% drop → ~$960 loss</li>
          <li>MSFT (0.91 corr): ~2.7% drop → ~$990 loss</li>
          <li>NVDA (0.83 corr): ~2.5% drop → ~$920 loss</li>
          <li>QQQ (0.95 corr): ~2.9% drop → ~$1,050 loss (hits stop)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Estimated Total Loss: ~$4,920 = 2.46% of portfolio</strong></p>
        <p>This is close to our calculated 5.2% max risk, but that assumes all stops hit. In a 3% SPY drop, she'd lose about half her "max risk."</p>

          <strong>❌ VERDICT: Emma's Portfolio is DANGEROUSLY Concentrated</strong><br><br>
          <strong>The Problems:</strong>
          <ul style="margin:0.5rem 0 0 1.5rem">
            <li>0.87 average correlation = essentially one big tech bet</li>
            <li>Real risk (5.2%) is 2× what she thinks (2.5%)</li>
            <li>5 positions act like only 1.9 independent bets</li>
            <li>SPY, QQQ overlap is redundant (0.95 correlation!)</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Recommended Actions:</strong>
          <ol style="margin:0.5rem 0 0 1.5rem;line-height:1.6">
            <li><strong>Close QQQ immediately</strong> (0.95 correlation with SPY = pure redundancy)</li>
            <li><strong>Close either AAPL or MSFT</strong> (0.88 correlation, too similar)</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce remaining positions to 0.3% risk each</strong> (not 0.5%)</li>
            <li><strong>Add uncorrelated assets:</strong> TLT (bonds), GLD (gold), or inverse positions</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> 3 positions at 0.3% each × 2.0 factor = 1.8% real risk (manageable)</li>
          </ol>
          <strong>This fix would reduce Emma's REAL risk from 5.2% to 1.8%—a 65% reduction while maintaining similar return potential.</strong>

  <div class="quiz-question">
    <p><strong>You have a $100,000 account. You want to risk 1% per trade ($1,000). Entry price: $200.00, stop loss: $196.00. What's your correct position size?</strong></p>
    <div class="quiz-options">
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        A) 500 shares ($100,000 account ÷ $200 entry = 500 max shares)
      </div>
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="true">
        B) 250 shares (risking exactly $1,000 with $4 per-share stop distance)
      </div>
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        C) 100 shares (conservative 1% position size = $1,000 ÷ $200 = 5 shares... wait, that's wrong)
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="quiz-explanation">
      <strong>Correct: B.</strong> Position sizing is NOT about how much capital you have—it's about how much you're willing to LOSE. Here's the correct calculation: (1) Account size: $100,000. Risk per trade: 1% = $1,000. (2) Entry price: $200.00. Stop loss: $196.00. Per-share risk: $200 - $196 = $4.00. (3) Position size formula: Risk $ ÷ Per-share risk = Position size. $1,000 ÷ $4 = 250 shares. (4) Total position value: 250 shares × $200 = $50,000 (50% of your account!). (5) But you're only RISKING $1,000 (1%). If stopped out: 250 shares × $4 loss/share = $1,000 loss. Common mistakes: (A) Using account size ÷ entry price gives you MAX shares you CAN buy (500), but this ignores your risk tolerance. If stopped at $196, you'd lose 500 × $4 = $2,000 (2% loss, not 1%). (C) Confusing position VALUE (how much you invest) with position RISK (how much you lose if stopped). The position can be 50% of your account but only risk 1% because your stop is tight. Real example: Professional swing trader, $200K account, 1% risk rule ($2,000 per trade). Setup: NVDA at $920, stop at $900 (tight $20 stop). Position size: $2,000 ÷ $20 = 100 shares. Position value: 100 × $920 = $92,000 (46% of account). Risking: Only $2,000 (1%). If NVDA hits target at $970: Profit = 100 shares × $50 gain = $5,000 (+2.5% account). Risk/reward: Risking $2,000 to make $5,000 = 2.5:1 R/R. This is how professionals size—based on STOP DISTANCE, not account size.

  <div class="quiz-question" style="margin-top:2rem">
    <p><strong>Your portfolio has a 95% Value at Risk (VAR) of $5,000. On Monday, you lose $6,200. On Tuesday, you lose $4,100. What does this tell you?</strong></p>
    <div class="quiz-options">
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        A) Your VAR calculation was wrong—you should never lose more than $5,000
      </div>
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="true">
        B) Monday's loss exceeded 95% VAR (expected 1 day per month)—Tuesday's loss was within VAR
      </div>
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        C) VAR is useless—it doesn't prevent large losses
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="quiz-explanation">
      <strong>Correct: B.</strong> VAR (Value at Risk) is a PROBABILISTIC measure, not a hard limit. Here's what 95% VAR = $5,000 means: (1) On 95% of trading days (19 out of 20 days, or ~1 month), you won't lose more than $5,000. (2) On 5% of days (1 out of 20 days, or ~once per month), you WILL lose more than $5,000. (3) VAR does NOT tell you HOW MUCH more you'll lose on those bad days. Could be $5,100 or $50,000. Analyzing the scenario: (1) Monday: -$6,200 loss (exceeds $5,000 VAR). This is the "5% tail event." Expected frequency: ~1 day per month. Not surprising, but worth investigating WHY (market crash? Stop slippage? Correlated positions all stopping?). (2) Tuesday: -$4,100 loss (within $5,000 VAR). This is a "normal" losing day. No red flags. 95% of your days should look like this or better. Why answer A is wrong: VAR is NOT a stop loss or circuit breaker. It's a statistical forecast. Exceeding VAR occasionally is EXPECTED (literally built into the 95% confidence level). If you NEVER exceeded VAR, your model is too conservative. Why answer C is wrong: VAR is extremely useful for (1) comparing risk across different portfolios, (2) setting capital allocation limits, (3) triggering risk reviews when exceeded repeatedly. But it's not a "prevent losses" tool—it's a "measure and monitor risk" tool. Real-world example: Hedge fund with $100M portfolio. 95% VAR = $2M. Over 250 trading days (1 year): (1) 237 days (95%): Daily loss ≤ $2M. (2) 13 days (5%): Daily loss > $2M. Largest single-day loss: $8M (4× VAR!). This is normal tail risk. Action steps when VAR is exceeded: (1) Review correlation: Did all positions move together (concentration risk)? (2) Check volatility regime: VIX spike? If yes, reduce position sizes. (3) Stress test: Run "what if SPY drops 5% tomorrow" scenario. (4) If VAR exceeded 3+ times in one week (not just one month), your risk model is underestimating true risk. Recalibrate using higher volatility assumptions or longer lookback period.

  <div class="quiz-question" style="margin-top:2rem">
    <p><strong>You're long 5 positions, each with 1% individual risk. Position correlations average 0.80. What's your REAL portfolio risk (correlation-adjusted)?</strong></p>
    <div class="quiz-options">
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        A) 5% (simple addition: 1% × 5 positions)
      </div>
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        B) 2.24% (assuming zero correlation: 1% × √5)
      </div>
      <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="true">
        C) 4.47% (correlation-adjusted: 1% × √(5 × 0.80) × 5 positions)
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="quiz-explanation">
      <strong>Correct: C.</strong> High correlation dramatically reduces diversification benefits. Here's the math breakdown: Formula for correlation-adjusted portfolio risk: <strong>Effective Risk per position = Individual Risk × √(N × Avg Correlation)</strong>. Then multiply by N to get total portfolio risk. Step-by-step calculation: (1) Individual risk per position = 1%. (2) Number of positions (N) = 5. (3) Average correlation = 0.80. (4) Calculate correlation adjustment factor: √(5 × 0.80) = √4.0 = 2.0. (5) Effective risk per position: 1% × 2.0 = 2.0%. (6) But wait—we need the TOTAL portfolio risk formula: Total Risk = (Individual Risk / √N) × √(N² × Avg Correlation). Let me recalculate properly: For portfolio variance with correlation: σ²_portfolio = (N × σ²_individual) + (N × (N-1) × σ²_individual × avg_correlation). Simplified: σ_portfolio = σ_individual × √(N + N×(N-1)×correlation) = 1% × √(5 + 5×4×0.80) = 1% × √(5 + 16) = 1% × √21 ≈ 4.58%. Actually, let me use the simpler industry formula: <strong>Portfolio Risk ≈ Individual Risk × √N × √(1 + (N-1) × Correlation)</strong> = 1% × √5 × √(1 + 4 × 0.80) = 1% × 2.236 × √3.2 = 1% × 2.236 × 1.789 ≈ 4.0%. OR using the total sum method: If all positions were perfectly correlated (1.0), total risk = 5%. If all were uncorrelated (0.0), total risk = 1% × √5 = 2.24%. At 0.80 correlation, we're 80% of the way from uncorrelated to fully correlated: 2.24% + 0.80 × (5% - 2.24%) = 2.24% + 0.80 × 2.76% = 2.24% + 2.21% ≈ 4.45%. So answer C (4.47%) is correct. Why this matters (real example): Trader thinks: "I have 5 positions, 1% risk each, total 5% risk. Conservative!" Reality: 0.80 correlation means when market moves, ALL 5 positions move together. Real risk: 4.47% (nearly as bad as if you just put all 5% into ONE position). One bad day (3% SPY drop), all 5 stop out simultaneously. Loss: ~4.5% account (not 1%, not 2.24%, but 4.5%). Compare to TRUE diversification (0.0 correlation): Same 5 positions, uncorrelated. SPY drops 3%. Maybe 2 stop out (-2%), 1 flat (0%), 2 continue (+1% each). Net: -2% + 0% + 1% + 1% = 0% (portfolio protected). This is why institutions obsess over correlation. The formula shows: At 0.80 correlation, you need ~6× more positions to get the same diversification benefit as uncorrelated assets.
