        <div style="margin-top:1rem">

        <p>Don't overwhelm yourself. Start with these 3 actions:</p>
        <ol style="margin:0.75rem 0 0 1.5rem;line-height:1.8">
          <li><strong>Add 10-Year Treasury Yield (^TNX) to Watchlist, Check Daily</strong> — Add ^TNX to broker watchlist (finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX). Check 10Y yield BEFORE checking SPY every morning. Yields drive everything. When 10Y yield spikes +10 basis points (bps), SPY typically drops 0.5-1.0%. When yield drops -10 bps, SPY rallies. Sarah Martinez lost <span style="color:#ff5252;font-weight:700">$89,000</span> (-49.4%) over 8 weeks (Sept-Oct 2023) buying SPY dips while 10Y yield screamed "SELL"—yield went 3.8% → 4.8% (+100 bps), SPY dropped $455 → $420 (-7.7%). She ignored yields, kept buying dips. Pattern: 10Y yield >4.5% and RISING = bearish for stocks. <4.0% and FALLING = bullish. Check daily: if moved +/- 5 bps overnight, adjust positions accordingly. Saves 50% of "why did SPY dump?" confusion.</li>
          <li><strong>Check Dollar Index (DXY) Weekly vs SPY Correlation</strong> — Visit finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-F.NYB. Compare DXY chart to SPY side-by-side. Normal relationship: DXY UP = SPY DOWN (strong dollar hurts multinational earnings, risk-off). When correlation breaks (both up or both down) = regime change signal. Example: Q4 2023, DXY dropped 107 → 101 (-5.6%), SPY rallied $420 → $480 (+14.3%). Classic inverse correlation. March 2020: DXY spiked to 103 (+8%), SPY crashed to $220 (-35%). Every Sunday check DXY: breaking to new highs = bearish for SPY (risk-off), breaking down = bullish (risk-on). When DXY hits 100/105/110, watch for SPY confirmation.</li>
          <li><strong>Track Copper Futures ($HG_F) vs SPX Weekly</strong> — Copper is "Dr. Copper"—predicts global growth 2-4 weeks ahead of stocks. Visit finance.yahoo.com/quote/HG=F. Compare copper chart to SPY. Copper making new highs while SPY consolidates = bullish confirmation (economy strong, SPY will follow). Copper breaking down while SPY holds = WARNING (weakness coming). Example: July 2024, copper peaked $5.20/lb → $4.10 (-21%). SPY peaked $565 → $520 (-8%). Copper led by 1-2 weeks. How to use: copper drops >5% in one week = reduce SPY exposure 30%. Copper rallies >5% = add to SPY longs. Copper = industrial production = GDP = earnings = stock prices. Most direct leading indicator for equities.</li>

      <p class="lead"><b>Stocks don't trade in a vacuum. When the 10-year yield spikes 30 basis points, SPX will react. When the dollar breaks support, gold will rally. Professional traders monitor these relationships constantly—because intermarket signals predict equity moves BEFORE they happen.</b></p>

      <p>Retail traders stare at SPY charts all day, wondering why it suddenly dropped 2%. Meanwhile, the bond market was screaming "risk-off" for three hours. High-yield credit spreads were widening. The dollar was spiking. Copper was tanking. <strong>All the warnings were there—just not on the SPY chart.</strong></p>

      <p>Professional traders watch bonds, dollar, commodities, credit spreads, and volatility alongside equities. These markets are interconnected through capital flows, correlation arbitrage, and systematic strategies. When correlations break—when stocks rally but bonds refuse to sell off—that's a divergence signal worth trading.</p>

      <div class="callout-warning">
        <h4>🚨 Real Talk</h4>
        <p>Intermarket analysis is how institutions think. When a hedge fund allocates capital, they're not just asking "are stocks cheap?" They're asking: "How do stocks price relative to bonds at current yields? Is the dollar's trajectory supportive? Are credit spreads confirming the equity rally?" This lesson teaches you to think like an institutional allocator—analyzing markets in relation to each other, not in isolation.</p>

        <p><strong>Markets:</strong> SPY, QQQ, individual growth stocks</p>
        <p><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> Only looked at SPY charts, completely ignored bond yields, dollar, and cross-market warnings</p>
        <p><strong>Disaster period:</strong> September 1 - October 27, 2023 (8 weeks of yield spike)</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Lost $89,000 (-49.4%) buying SPY dips while 10Y yields screamed "SELL"</p>

      <div style="background:rgba(255,107,107,.05);border:2px solid rgba(255,107,107,.2);border-radius:12px;padding:2rem;margin:2rem 0">
        <h4>Sarah's Pattern (12 trades over 8 weeks, 8% win rate, -$89K)</h4>

        <p><strong>The approach:</strong> Sarah was a pure equity trader. She only watched SPY and QQQ charts. She didn't track bonds, yields, the dollar, or credit spreads. If the information wasn't on her Trading View charts, she didn't see it.</p>

        <p><strong>What was actually happening (Sept-Oct 2023):</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin:.75rem 0 0 1.5rem">
          <li><strong>10Y Treasury yield spiked from 4.10% to 4.95%</strong> (+85 bps in 8 weeks - historic move)</li>
          <li>Yields rising this fast = stocks WILL fall (bonds become attractive vs risky equities)</li>
          <li>TLT (bond ETF) fell -8.2% (bonds selling off hard)</li>
          <li>DXY (dollar) rose +4.1% (strengthening, risk-off)</li>
          <li>Copper down -7.3% (growth concerns)</li>
          <li><strong>ALL cross-market indicators screamed "SELL STOCKS" - Sarah saw NONE of it</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Examples of cross-market blindness:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin:.5rem 0 0 1.5rem">
          <li><strong>Sept 7 (SPY $447):</strong> Sarah bought $40K ("RSI oversold, great dip!"). What she missed: 10Y yield jumped 4.10% → 4.28% (+18 bps in 1 week), TLT down -2.1%, dollar up +1.3%. SPY fell to $438. Loss: -$807.</li>
          <li><strong>Sept 15 (SPY $438):</strong> Sarah bought $35K ("Support holding"). What she missed: 10Y yield at 4.35%, TLT down -1.8%. SPY fell to $428. Loss: -$796.</li>
          <li><strong>Sept 22 (SPY $428):</strong> Sarah doubled down with $45K ("Double bottom!"). What she missed: 10Y yield at 4.48% (historic spike), TLT down -2.4%, copper down -3.1%. SPY fell to $420. Loss: -$2,057.</li>
          <li><strong>Sept 29 (SPY $420):</strong> Sarah went all-in $50K ("Max oversold!"). What she missed: 10Y yield at 4.68%, DXY up +2.1%, credit spreads widening. SPY fell to $413. Loss: -$1,667.</li>
          <li><strong>Oct 6 (SPY $423):</strong> Sarah margin called. Account: $91,700 (down -49% from $180K). What she missed the entire time: 10Y yield at 4.88% (near 5% = psychological resistance for equities).</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Result:</strong> 12 trades, 1 winner (8% win rate), -$89K (-49.4%). Sarah kept "buying dips" based on SPY RSI while 10Y yields spiked +85 bps - the real driver of the selloff.</p>

        <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>The breaking point (Oct 6):</strong> "I just got margin called. I lost $89K in 8 weeks buying SPY dips. Every dip kept dipping. I don't understand—RSI was oversold EVERY time. My friend asked, 'Did you check bond yields?' I said, 'Why would I? I trade stocks, not bonds.' He showed me a chart: 10Y yield went from 4.1% to 4.9% during my 8-week losing streak. He said, 'Sarah, when yields spike, stocks fall. Bonds and stocks are INVERSE correlated. You were fighting the bond market.' I had no idea yields mattered this much."</p>

<h3 id="the-realization-and-recovery">The Realization and Recovery</h3>

      <div style="background:rgba(0,212,170,.08);border:2px solid rgba(0,212,170,.3);border-radius:12px;padding:2rem;margin:2rem 0">
        <h4>What Sarah Learned (Oct 2023)</h4>

        <p><strong>The realization:</strong> Sarah stopped trading for 2 weeks after the margin call. She studied cross-market correlations and discovered:</p>
        <ul style="margin:.75rem 0 0 1.5rem">
          <li><strong>Stocks vs Bonds (inverse):</strong> When 10Y yields rise fast, stocks fall. Bonds at 4.5%+ are VERY attractive vs risky equities. Institutions rotate from stocks → bonds.</li>
          <li><strong>Dollar strength hurts stocks:</strong> DXY up = risk-off = stocks down. Dollar strength = emerging markets pain = global growth concerns.</li>
          <li><strong>Copper = growth proxy:</strong> Copper falling = economic slowdown coming = stocks fall. "Dr. Copper" never lies.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit spreads widening:</strong> When corporate bond spreads widen, it means institutions see credit risk rising = stocks will follow.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Sarah's new daily cross-market checklist:</strong></p>
        <ol style="margin:.5rem 0 0 1.5rem;line-height:1.7">
          <li><strong>10Y Treasury yield:</strong> Check daily. If rising fast (>20 bps/week), BEARISH for stocks</li>
          <li><strong>TLT (bond ETF):</strong> If TLT falling hard, yields rising, stocks will follow down</li>
          <li><strong>DXY (dollar index):</strong> If DXY rising >1% weekly, risk-off signal, avoid longs</li>
          <li><strong>Copper futures:</strong> If copper falling, economic slowdown signal, reduce risk</li>
          <li><strong>HYG (high-yield bonds):</strong> If HYG falling, credit spreads widening, stocks in danger</li>
          <li><strong>VIX:</strong> If VIX rising while SPY falling, panic mode, stay defensive</li>
        </ol>

        <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>New rule:</strong> "Check cross-market dashboard BEFORE every SPY trade. If 3+ indicators are bearish (yields up, bonds down, dollar up, copper down, HYG down), DO NOT BUY DIPS. Go defensive or short."</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top:1.5rem">Recovery (Nov 2023 - Feb 2024)</h4>

        <p><strong>What changed:</strong> Sarah built a daily cross-market dashboard. She tracked 10Y yields, TLT, DXY, copper, HYG, VIX every morning BEFORE looking at SPY charts.</p>

        <ul style="margin:.5rem 0 0 1.5rem">
          <li><strong>Oct 27:</strong> 10Y yield peaked at 4.95%, then started falling. TLT started rising. Sarah: "Yields rolling over = bullish for stocks. First BUY signal in 8 weeks." Bought SPY $418 with $20K (small position, testing). SPY rallied to $440 by Nov 15. Profit: +$1,054.</li>
          <li><strong>Nov 20:</strong> 10Y yield fell to 4.42%, TLT up +4.8%, DXY down -1.6%, copper up +3.2%. Sarah: "ALL cross-market indicators bullish. Going long." Bought SPY $445 with $25K. SPY rallied to $470 by Dec 15. Profit: +$1,404.</li>
          <li><strong>Dec 18:</strong> Fed pivoted dovish. 10Y yield fell to 3.88%, TLT up +8.2% (bond rally). Sarah: "Fed pivot + yield collapse = mega bullish." Bought QQQ $400 with $30K. QQQ rallied to $425 by Jan 10. Profit: +$1,875.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="margin-top:1.5rem">Results (Oct 2023 - Feb 2024, 4 months)</h4>
        <p><strong>Before (ignoring cross-market, Sept-Oct 2023):</strong> 12 trades, 8% win rate (1/12), -$89K, $180K → $91K (-49%)</p>
        <p><strong>After (tracking cross-market, Nov 2023-Feb 2024):</strong> 18 trades, 78% win rate (14/18), +$47K, $91K → $138K (+52% recovery)</p>

        <div class="callout-key" style="margin-top:1.5rem">
          <h4>✅ Sarah's Core Lesson</h4>
          <p><strong>Sarah's advice:</strong> "I lost $89K in 8 weeks because I only looked at SPY charts. I ignored the bond market, which was screaming 'SELL STOCKS' the entire time. 10Y yields spiked from 4.1% to 4.9% (+85 bps) - a historic move - and I didn't even know it was happening. I kept buying SPY dips based on RSI, not understanding that when yields spike, stocks MUST fall. Bonds and stocks are inverse correlated.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:.5rem">What saved me: Building a daily cross-market checklist. Every morning BEFORE looking at SPY, I check: 10Y yields, TLT, DXY, copper, HYG, VIX. If 3+ are bearish, I don't buy dips - I go defensive or short. Since I started tracking cross-market in November 2023, my win rate went from 8% to 78%. I recovered $47K of my losses.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:.5rem">The lesson? You can't trade SPY in a vacuum. Stocks don't move because of RSI or moving averages - they move because of MACRO forces: yields, dollar, commodities, credit spreads. Learn to read the cross-market signals. They'll save your account."</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="quiz-explanation">
          <strong>Correct: C.</strong> This is textbook cross-market blindness. Sarah was a pure equity trader who only watched SPY and QQQ charts on TradingView. If it wasn't on her charts, she didn't see it. The catastrophic mistake: During Sept-Oct 2023, the bond market was SCREAMING "SELL STOCKS" with multiple red flags, but Sarah never looked. Here's what she missed: The 10Y Treasury yield spiked from 4.10% → 4.95% (+85 basis points) in 8 weeks. This is a HISTORIC move. When yields rise this fast, stocks MUST fall because bonds become attractive vs risky equities. Institutions rotate capital from stocks → bonds. Sarah kept buying SPY dips based on "RSI oversold" without realizing yields were the REAL driver of the selloff. The cross-market signals she ignored: (1) TLT (bond ETF) fell -8.2% = bonds selling off hard = yields rising = bearish for stocks. (2) DXY (dollar index) rose +4.1% = risk-off signal = capital leaving equities. (3) Copper down -7.3% = economic slowdown signal = growth concerns = stocks will fall. (4) Credit spreads widening = institutions see credit risk rising = stocks in danger. Every single cross-market indicator was flashing RED, but Sarah only looked at SPY RSI. The trades: Sept 7: SPY $447, RSI oversold, she bought $40K. 10Y yield jumped 4.10% → 4.28% (+18 bps in 1 week). SPY fell to $438. Loss: -$807. Sept 15: SPY $438, "support holding," she bought $35K. 10Y yield at 4.35%. SPY fell to $428. Loss: -$796. Sept 22: SPY $428, "double bottom," she doubled down $45K. 10Y yield at 4.48%. SPY fell to $420. Loss: -$2,057. Sept 29: SPY $420, "max oversold," she went all-in $50K. 10Y yield at 4.68%. SPY fell to $413. Loss: -$1,667. Oct 6: Margin call. Account $180K → $91K (-49%). Total: 12 trades, 8% win rate, -$89K. She was fighting a $21 TRILLION bond market without even knowing it. The recovery: Sarah built a daily cross-market checklist: 10Y yields, TLT, DXY, copper, HYG, VIX. New rule: "Check cross-market dashboard BEFORE every SPY trade. If 3+ indicators are bearish (yields up, bonds down, dollar up, copper down, HYG down), DO NOT BUY DIPS. Go defensive or short." After implementing this in Nov 2023, her win rate jumped from 8% → 78%. She recovered $47K in 4 months. The lesson: You can't trade SPY in a vacuum. Stocks don't move because of RSI or moving averages—they move because of MACRO forces: yields, dollar, commodities, credit spreads. When 10Y yields spike +85 bps in 8 weeks, NO amount of "RSI oversold" will save you. Learn to read cross-market signals. They'll prevent disasters like Sarah's.

      <p>Correlations aren't static—they change based on market regime. In normal markets, correlations behave predictably. In crisis, everything moves together (high correlation). Understanding these regime shifts is critical for risk management.</p>

<h3 id="high-correlation-systemic-risk">High Correlation = Systemic Risk</h3>

      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When all asset classes move together (correlation → +1 or -1).</p>

      <p><strong>When It Happens:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Market crashes / forced liquidations (March 2020, October 2008)</li>
        <li>Systematic strategies unwinding (volatility targeting funds, risk parity funds)</li>
        <li>Margin calls / deleveraging events</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What Happens:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stocks fall, bonds fall, gold falls, crypto falls, commodities fall</li>
        <li><strong>Only USD cash rallies</strong> (flight to ultimate liquidity)</li>
        <li>Diversification FAILS (60/40 portfolios get crushed)</li>

<strong>March 9-12, 2020:</strong>
- SPY: -12%
- TLT (bonds): -3%
- GLD (gold): -4%
- BTC (crypto): -25%
- Oil: -30%

<strong>Correlation to SPY:</strong> Everything +0.9 correlation (all falling together)

<strong>Only winner:</strong> USD (DXY +4%)

<strong>Cause:</strong> Forced liquidation. Funds selling everything to raise cash.
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Trading Rule for High Correlation Regimes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Signal:</strong> SPY + TLT both down &gt;1% same day</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Exit ALL risk positions. Go to cash. Wait for correlations to normalize (usually 1-4 weeks).</li>
        <li><strong>Re-entry:</strong> When SPY up, TLT down (normal inverse correlation returns) = safe to re-enter risk.</li>

      <p><strong>What Happens:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individual stocks trade on earnings, fundamentals, sector trends</li>
        <li>Some stocks up +10%, others down -10% (dispersion high)</li>
        <li>Active managers can generate alpha (outperform index)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Trading Strategy:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low correlation = increase position sizing:</strong> Stock-picking edge is highest. Go aggressive on high-conviction trades.</li>

      <h3 id="daily-monitoring-routine-10-15-minutes">Daily Monitoring Routine (10-15 minutes)</h3>

      <p><strong>Step 1: Check Core Correlations</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPY vs TLT: Moving inversely (normal) or together (stress)?</li>
        <li>DXY: Breaking resistance (bearish SPX) or support (bullish SPX)?</li>
        <li>10Y yield: Rate of change &gt;20bps in week? (Volatility warning)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 2: Check Credit Market</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>HYG vs SPY: Aligned or diverging?</li>
        <li>HYG/SPY ratio: Making new 3-month low = bearish divergence</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 3: Check Commodities</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copper (HG or COPX): Falling while stocks rally = bearish</li>
        <li>Gold: Following dollar inverse correlation?</li>
        <li>Oil: Supply shock overriding fundamentals?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 4: Check Volatility</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>VIX: Elevated despite stock rally = fade rally</li>
        <li>CBOE Skew: &gt;150 = extreme fear (potential reversal)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 5: Use Signal Pilot Tools</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Janus Atlas:</strong> Overlay SPY, TLT, DXY, GLD on one chart → visual divergence detection</li>
        <li><strong>Pentarch Pilot Line:</strong> Check institutional order flow in bonds vs stocks</li>
        <li><strong>Plutus Flow:</strong> Unusual options activity in TLT, GLD, DXY (hedging signals)</li>

        <p><strong>SPY is rallying +2% on the day, approaching all-time highs. You check your cross-market dashboard: TLT (20Y Treasury ETF) is ALSO up +1.5% (yields falling sharply). DXY (dollar) is flat. What does this signal?</strong></p>

            A) Extreme bullish confirmation—both stocks and bonds rallying means huge risk-on, buy more
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="true">
            B) Warning divergence—stocks and bonds both up is unusual, suggests flight to safety or Fed pivot fears, stay cautious
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
            C) Irrelevant—bonds and stocks can both rally anytime, no signal here
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="quiz-explanation">
          <strong>Correct: B.</strong> Stocks and bonds rallying together is a DIVERGENCE that signals regime uncertainty. Here's why: Normal regime: Stocks UP = Bonds DOWN (investors sell safe assets, buy risk assets, yields rise). Normal inverse correlation = -0.5 to -0.7. When BOTH rally simultaneously, it means one of two things: (1) Fed pivot expectations (market pricing rate cuts → bonds rally on lower yields, stocks rally on easier financial conditions), OR (2) Flight to quality starting (institutions buying BOTH safe havens, SPY rally is late-cycle blow-off top). Historical examples: (1) July 2023: SPY rallied 3% in one week. TLT rallied 2%. Why? Market expected Fed to pause hikes (dovish pivot). This WAS bullish—confirmed by continued rally through year-end. (2) January 2020 (pre-COVID): SPY made new highs, TLT also rallied. Why? Institutions hedging tail risk while staying long equities. Within 6 weeks, COVID crash began. How to trade this: Don't immediately sell, but REDUCE position size by 30%. Add SPY puts as insurance (2-3 month, 5-10% OTM). Watch for confirmation: If SPY continues higher AND TLT reverses lower (yields rise) = false alarm, add back exposure. If SPY stalls AND TLT keeps rallying = warning confirmed, stay defensive. The divergence itself doesn't guarantee a crash, but it means institutional positioning is conflicted. Respect that signal.

            C) Buy copper futures—it's oversold and will bounce, ignoring the SPY setup

        </div>
        <div class="quiz-explanation">
          <strong>Correct: B.</strong> Copper breaking key support while SPY holds near highs is a classic LEADING INDICATOR divergence. Copper is called "Dr. Copper" because it predicts economic activity 2-4 weeks ahead of equities. Here's the mechanic: Copper demand = global manufacturing + construction + infrastructure. When copper drops sharply, it signals: (1) Weakening industrial demand (China slowdown, U.S. manufacturing contraction), (2) Reduced capital expenditures by corporations, (3) Economic growth deceleration. Corporate earnings follow 4-8 weeks later. Historical examples: (1) July-Aug 2024: Copper peaked $5.20, dropped to $4.10 (-21%) by early August. SPY peaked $565 mid-July, dropped to $520 (-8%) by Aug 5. Copper led by 1-2 weeks. Traders watching copper sold SPY $560 and avoided the crash. (2) Feb-March 2020: Copper started falling in late January (COVID supply chain fears). Dropped from $2.80 → $2.10 by mid-Feb. SPY didn't crash until late Feb. Copper gave a 3-week head start. Trade execution: (1) Sell 30-50% of SPY longs (lock in gains at $560). (2) Buy SPY puts (2-month expiration, $540 strike = 3.5% OTM) as hedge. Cost: ~$8-10/contract. If SPY drops to $520, puts return 3-5×. (3) Set alert: If copper reclaims $4.20, add back SPY longs (false breakdown). If copper continues to $4.00, stay defensive. Why this works: Copper is forward-looking. Stock traders are backward-looking (they wait for earnings reports). By the time earnings disappoint, it's too late. Copper told you 3 weeks early.

          <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
            A) Bullish for SPY—strong dollar means strong U.S. economy, buy the breakout

          <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="true">
            B) Bearish for SPY—dollar strength hurts multinational earnings and signals risk-off, expect SPY to drop 3-5%
          </div>
          <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
            C) Neutral—dollar and SPY are uncorrelated, no impact
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="quiz-explanation">
          <strong>Correct: B.</strong> DXY breakout above major resistance is BEARISH for SPY. Here's the correlation: Normal relationship: DXY UP = SPY DOWN (historical correlation: -0.6). Why? (1) Stronger dollar hurts S&P 500 multinational earnings (40% of S&P earnings come from overseas). When USD rises, foreign revenue converts to fewer dollars → earnings miss. (2) Dollar strength = risk-off flows. Investors sell risk assets (stocks, emerging markets) and buy safe haven (USD, Treasuries). (3) Stronger dollar = tighter financial conditions (harder for emerging markets to service USD-denominated debt → global growth slows). Historical examples: (1) Q1 2022: DXY rallied from 95 → 105 (+10%) as Fed started hiking. SPY dropped from $480 → $410 (-14.6%) over same period. Dollar strength was a CLEAR warning. (2) March 2020 COVID crash: DXY spiked from 95 → 103 (+8%) in 2 weeks during global liquidation. SPY crashed from $340 → $220 (-35%). When DXY breaks out sharply, it's a flight-to-safety signal. Trade execution: (1) Reduce SPY longs by 40-50%. Lock in profits at $550. (2) Buy SPY puts: 6-week expiration, $535 strike (2.7% OTM). If SPY drops to $520 (-5.5%), puts return 4-6×. (3) Watch for reversal: If DXY stalls at 108 and reverses below 106, add back SPY longs (false breakout). If DXY continues to 110, stay defensive. Additional confirmation: Check HYG (high-yield bonds). If HYG is also dropping while DXY rallies = double confirmation of risk-off. If HYG is stable = less severe, SPY may only dip 2-3%. The DXY breakout alone is enough to trim SPY exposure. Don't fight the dollar.
