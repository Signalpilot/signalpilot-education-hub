      <p class="lead"><b>Stocks don't trade in a vacuum. When the 10-year yield spikes 30 basis points, SPX will react. When the dollar breaks support, gold will rally. Professional traders monitor these relationships constantly—because intermarket signals predict equity moves BEFORE they happen.</b></p>

      <p>Retail traders stare at SPY charts all day, wondering why it suddenly dropped 2%. Meanwhile, the bond market was screaming "risk-off" for three hours. High-yield credit spreads were widening. The dollar was spiking. Copper was tanking. <strong>All the warnings were there—just not on the SPY chart.</strong></p>

      <p>Professional traders watch bonds, dollar, commodities, credit spreads, and volatility alongside equities. These markets are interconnected through capital flows, correlation arbitrage, and systematic strategies. When correlations break—when stocks rally but bonds refuse to sell off—that's a divergence signal worth trading.</p>

      <div class="callout-warning">
        <h4>🚨 Real Talk</h4>
        <p>Intermarket analysis is how institutions think. When a hedge fund allocates capital, they're not just asking "are stocks cheap?" They're asking: "How do stocks price relative to bonds at current yields? Is the dollar's trajectory supportive? Are credit spreads confirming the equity rally?" This lesson teaches you to think like an institutional allocator—analyzing markets in relation to each other, not in isolation.</p>

        <p><strong>Trader:</strong> Sarah Martinez, 6-year equity trader from Chicago ($180,000 account)</p>
        <p><strong>Markets:</strong> SPY, QQQ, individual growth stocks</p>
        <p><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> Only looked at SPY charts, completely ignored bond yields, dollar, and cross-market warnings</p>
        <p><strong>Disaster period:</strong> September 1 - October 27, 2023 (8 weeks of yield spike)</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Lost $89,000 (-49.4%) buying SPY dips while 10Y yields screamed "SELL"</p>
        <p><strong>Recovery:</strong> Built daily cross-market checklist → Gained $47K in 4 months (52% recovery)</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah's approach:</strong> She was a pure equity trader. She only watched SPY and QQQ charts. She didn't track bonds, yields, the dollar, or credit spreads. If the information wasn't on her TradingView charts, she didn't see it.</p>

              <li>SPY pulled back from $455 to $447 (Sep 1-7)</li>

- TLT flat (yields not threatening)
- DXY weak (103.8 → 103.2)
- HYG strong (credit spreads tightening)

          <h4>❌ Sarah's Old Approach (Lost $89K)</h4>

          <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code>Sept-Oct 2023: Historic yield spike (4.1% → 5%)
Sarah: "SPY is dipping. Buying the dip!"

Sarah's view: "I don't need to check bonds.
              SPY RSI is oversold. That's enough."

Result: Every dip kept dipping
- Sept 1: SPY $455
- Oct 27: SPY $410 (down -9.9%)

          <h4>✅ Sarah's New Approach (Gained $47K)</h4>
          <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Daily cross-market checklist BEFORE trading</p>
          <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code>Late Oct 2023: Yields PEAK at 5.02%, then reverse
Sarah's new analysis:
"10Y yield falling -30 bps in 2 weeks = bullish
TLT rallying +3.2% (bonds up = stocks next)
DXY weakening (risk-on signal)
NOW I can buy SPY."

New framework (every morning):
1. Check 10Y yield (level + change)
2. Check TLT (bonds up or down?)
3. Check DXY (dollar strong or weak?)
4. Check HYG (credit spreads?)
5. THEN trade SPY based on alignment

Sarah's recovery (Nov 2023 - Feb 2024):
- Bought SPY when yields FELL (Nov, Dec, Feb)
- Stayed OUT when yields SPIKED (Jan 25)
- Win rate: 75% (12/16)
- Profit: +$47.3K (+52% from low)

        <h4 style="margin-top:0">📋 Sarah's Morning Cross-Market Routine (5 Minutes Before Trading)</h4>
        <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code>STEP 1: BONDS & YIELDS (Most Important!)
[ ] 10Y Treasury Yield: _____% (current level)
[ ] Change from yesterday: [ ] +___bps (bearish) [ ] -___bps (bullish)
[ ] Change from last week: [ ] +___bps [ ] -___bps
[ ] TLT (20+ Year Bonds): [ ] UP (yields falling, bullish stocks)
                          [ ] DOWN (yields rising, bearish stocks)

YIELD SIGNALS:
[ ] 🟢 Yields FALLING 3+ days: BULLISH for stocks (buy dips)
[ ] 🔴 Yields RISING >15 bps/week: BEARISH for stocks (sell rallies)
[ ] ⚠️ Yields >4.5%: CAUTION (bonds competing with stocks)

STEP 2: DOLLAR STRENGTH (DXY / UUP)
[ ] DXY: _____ (current level)
[ ] Trend: [ ] Strengthening (bearish stocks) [ ] Weakening (bullish stocks)
[ ] Change this week: [ ] +___% [ ] -___%

DOLLAR SIGNALS:
[ ] 🟢 DXY falling (weak dollar): BULLISH stocks, commodities
[ ] 🔴 DXY rising >2% in week: BEARISH stocks (global tightening)

STEP 3: CREDIT SPREADS (HYG vs TLT)
[ ] HYG (High Yield Bonds): [ ] UP (spreads tightening, risk-on)
                             [ ] DOWN (spreads widening, risk-off)
[ ] HYG vs SPY: [ ] Aligned (both up/down = healthy)
                [ ] Diverging (HYG weak, SPY strong = WARNING)

CREDIT SIGNALS:
[ ] 🟢 HYG outperforming SPY: Institutions confident (risk-on)
[ ] 🔴 HYG underperforming SPY: Institutions worried (caution)

STEP 4: COMMODITIES CONFIRMATION
[ ] GLD (Gold): [ ] UP (weak dollar / risk-off)
                [ ] DOWN (strong dollar / risk-on)
[ ] Copper: [ ] UP (growth optimism) [ ] DOWN (growth concerns)
[ ] Oil (USO): [ ] UP [ ] DOWN

STEP 5: CORRELATION CHECK (Critical!)
Compare SPY vs TLT movement:
[ ] 🟢 SPY up, TLT down (yields up) = NORMAL RISK-ON
[ ] 🟢 SPY down, TLT up (yields down) = NORMAL RISK-OFF
[ ] 🔴 SPY down, TLT down (yields up) = DANGER! Forced liquidation
[ ] ⚠️ SPY up, TLT up (yields down) = Fed easing / QE environment

STEP 6: TRADING DECISION

IF ALL GREEN (yields falling, dollar weak, credit strong):
[ ] Bias: AGGRESSIVE LONG (buy SPY/QQQ dips confidently)
[ ] Position size: 50-75% of capital
[ ] Stop: Below recent swing low

IF MIXED SIGNALS (some green, some red):
[ ] Bias: SELECTIVE (trade smaller, tighter stops)
[ ] Position size: 25-50% of capital
[ ] Focus: High-conviction setups only

IF ALL RED (yields spiking, dollar strong, credit weak):
[ ] Bias: DEFENSIVE (stay cash or short)
[ ] Position size: 0-25% of capital
[ ] Action: Sell rallies, avoid longs, wait for reversal

CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER trade SPY without checking yields first
2. If 10Y yield spikes >20 bps in 3 days → potential exit longs immediately
3. If SPY & TLT both falling → emergency, go to cash
4. Yields >4.5% = bonds competing with stocks (reduce risk)
5. When in doubt, check cross-markets. They lead, stocks follow.</code></pre>

          <strong>Sarah's advice (March 2024):</strong><br>
          "I lost $89,000 in 8 weeks because I traded SPY in a vacuum. I only looked at SPY charts—RSI, support levels, moving averages. I never checked the bond market. I didn't even know what the 10-year yield was. Turns out, yields spiked from 4.1% to 5% during those 8 weeks—the biggest move in a decade. That's WHY stocks fell. Bonds at 5% became very attractive vs risky equities. Institutions rotated from stocks to bonds. But I had no idea.<br><br>
          What saved me: Learning that STOCKS DON'T TRADE IN A VACUUM. I now spend 5 minutes every morning checking yields, TLT, DXY, and HYG BEFORE I even look at SPY. If yields are spiking, I stay out or sell rallies. If yields are falling, I buy dips aggressively. My win rate went from 0% to 75%. I recovered $47K of my losses in 4 months.<br><br>
          The lesson? Stocks are just ONE piece of the puzzle. Bonds, dollar, commodities, and credit tell you WHERE stocks are going. Check cross-markets first. They lead. Stocks follow."

        <h4>⚠️ Critical Signal: Both Stocks AND Bonds Falling</h4>
        <p>When SPY AND TLT both fall on the same day, it signals <strong>systemic stress</strong>. Investors aren't rotating from stocks to bonds (normal risk-off). They're selling EVERYTHING to raise cash or meet margin calls.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>October 2008 (Lehman collapse): SPY -10%, TLT -5% same week</li>
          <li>March 2020 (COVID crash): SPY -12%, TLT -3% same day (March 12)</li>
          <li>September 2022 (UK pension crisis): Global bond/stock selloff</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Trading rule:</strong> When this happens, potential exit ALL risk positions immediately. Only USD cash and short-term T-bills are safe. Wait for correlations to normalize before re-entering.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="2-dollar-vs-stocks-dxy-vs-spx">2. Dollar vs Stocks (DXY vs SPX)</h3>

      <p><strong>Normal Relationship:</strong> Inverse correlation (moderate strength). Dollar up → stocks down. Dollar down → stocks up.</p>

      <p><strong>Why Dollar Strength Hurts Stocks:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Mechanism #1: Tighter Global Financial Conditions</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong USD = global dollar liquidity contracts (dollar is world's reserve currency)</li>
        <li>International borrowers struggle to service USD-denominated debt (emerging markets, corporates)</li>
        <li>Risk of EM currency crises → contagion to developed markets</li>
        <li>Historical examples: 2013 taper tantrum, 2015 China devaluation, 2022 UK gilt crisis</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Mechanism #2: Multinational Earnings Pressure</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>S&P 500 companies generate ~30% of revenue internationally</li>
        <li>Strong USD = foreign revenue worth less when converted back to dollars</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Apple earns €10B in Europe. EUR/USD at 1.10 = $11B revenue. EUR/USD falls to 1.00 = $10B revenue (10% haircut despite same European sales).</li>
        <li>Mega-caps (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) have highest international exposure → most sensitive to USD strength</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Mechanism #3: Risk Asset Repricing</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong USD often coincides with Fed tightening (raising rates)</li>
        <li>Higher rates = lower present value of future earnings (discount rate effect)</li>
        <li>Growth stocks (long-duration assets) most affected</li>

        <li><strong>Trading rule:</strong> DXY breaks support (-3%) = buy GLD. DXY breaks resistance (+3%) = sell GLD.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Oil vs Dollar:</strong> Moderate inverse correlation (-0.4 to -0.6)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Oil priced globally in USD → weak dollar = oil rises (international buyers get more purchasing power)</li>
        <li>Correlation weaker than gold (oil driven more by supply/demand fundamentals)</li>
        <li><strong>Exception:</strong> Supply shocks override dollar correlation (2022 Russia/Ukraine → oil spiked despite strong dollar)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Copper vs Stocks:</strong> Positive correlation (+0.6 to +0.8) with equities</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copper = "Dr. Copper" (has PhD in economics) → industrial demand proxy</li>
        <li>Used in construction, manufacturing, EVs, infrastructure</li>
        <li>When copper falls while stocks rally = <strong>bearish divergence</strong> (global growth slowing, equity rally will fail)</li>

<h2 id="part-2-intermarket-divergencesleading-indicators">Part 2: Intermarket Divergences—Leading Indicators</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-an-intermarket-divergence">What Is an Intermarket Divergence?</h3><p><strong>Divergence:</strong> When historically correlated assets break their normal relationship.</p>

      <p><strong>Why Divergences Matter:</strong> One asset is telling you something the other hasn't priced in yet. <strong>The divergence resolves by either (1) the lagging asset catching up, or (2) the leading asset reversing.</strong> Historically, the lagging asset catches up 70-80% of the time.</p>

      <h3 id="divergence-1-stocks-up-bonds-refusing-to-fall">Divergence #1: Stocks Up, Bonds Refusing to Fall</h3>

      <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPX making new 52-week highs</li>
        <li>TLT NOT making new 52-week lows (or even rising slightly)</li>
        <li>Yields NOT rising despite stock rally</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
      <p>Bond market is skeptical of equity rally. Possible reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rally is narrow (only a few mega-cap stocks, no breadth)</li>
        <li>Bond investors expect recession (buying bonds for safety despite equity strength)</li>
        <li>Liquidity concerns (institutions parking cash in bonds, not chasing stocks)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Trading Signal:</strong> <strong>Bearish</strong> for stocks. When bonds and stocks disagree, bonds are usually right (bond market is "smarter"—more institutional, less retail).</p>

      <p><strong>Trade Setup:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Entry:</strong> Short SPX when divergence lasts 2+ weeks</li>
        <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Use Signal Pilot Janus Atlas to check if SPX rally has breadth (all sectors up?) or just tech (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA)</li>
        <li><strong>Stop:</strong> If TLT starts falling (bonds confirm equity rally)</li>
        <li><strong>Target:</strong> SPX pullback 3-5% to close divergence</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="divergence-2-high-yield-credit-spreads-widening-stocks-rallying">Divergence #2: High-Yield Credit Spreads Widening, Stocks Rallying</h3>

      <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPX making new highs</li>
        <li>HYG (high-yield bond ETF) falling</li>
        <li>Credit spreads (HY bonds vs Treasuries) widening</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What It Means:</strong></p>
      <p>Credit market is pricing in recession / default risk. Credit investors (bond investors) smell trouble—expecting companies to struggle paying debt.</p>

      <p><strong>Why Credit Leads Equities:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bondholders get paid before shareholders in bankruptcy → more conservative, forward-looking</li>
        <li>Credit analysts study company balance sheets, leverage, cash flow (more fundamental analysis than equity day traders)</li>
        <li>Historical pattern: Credit sells off 2-6 weeks BEFORE major equity corrections</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Real Example: January 2022</strong></p>
      <pre style="background:rgba(255,71,71,.05);padding:1rem;border-radius:6px;overflow-x:auto">
<strong>Dec 2021:</strong> SPX at 4800 (new all-time highs)
<strong>HYG:</strong> Peaked Dec 6, down -2% by Jan 1

<strong>Divergence Signal:</strong> Credit selling off despite equity ATH

<strong>Jan 2022:</strong> SPX drops -8.7% (Jan 3-24)
<strong>Credit was right.</strong> Equity investors caught offside.

<strong>Trade:</strong> If you shorted SPX when HYG broke support
(Dec 20), you captured 8% downside over next month.
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Trading Rule:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor HYG/SPY ratio daily</li>
        <li>If HYG/SPY makes new 3-month low while SPX makes new 3-month high = <strong>major bearish divergence</strong></li>
        <li>Enter puts on SPX or reduce long exposure immediately</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="divergence-3-copper-falling-stocks-rallying-dr-copper-divergence">Divergence #3: Copper Falling, Stocks Rallying ("Dr. Copper" Divergence)</h3>

      <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPX making new highs (or trending up)</li>
        <li>Copper futures (HG) or copper ETF (COPX) falling -5-10%</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
      <p>Industrial demand is weakening. Global growth is slowing. Copper is used in construction, manufacturing, EVs, infrastructure—if demand is falling, it signals economic slowdown ahead.</p>

      <p><strong>Trading Implications:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bearish for cyclical stocks:</strong> Materials (XLB), Industrials (XLI), Energy (XLE)</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive rotation coming:</strong> Expect rotation into Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), Healthcare (XLV)</li>
        <li><strong>SPX correction likely:</strong> If copper keeps falling, SPX will eventually follow (cyclicals drag index lower)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Real Example: Summer 2022</strong></p>
      <pre style="background:rgba(255,71,71,.05);padding:1rem;border-radius:6px;overflow-x:auto">
<strong>June 2022:</strong> SPX rebounds from May lows (+8% rally)
<strong>Copper:</strong> Continues falling -15% from April highs

<strong>Divergence:</strong> Stocks rallying, copper (global growth proxy) tanking

<strong>July-Sept 2022:</strong> SPX drops -12% (new lows in October)
<strong>Copper was right.</strong> Global recession fears materialized.

<strong>Trade:</strong> Short cyclicals (XLI, XLB) when copper broke support
in June. Outperformed shorting SPX directly.
      </pre>

      <h3 id="divergence-4-vix-staying-elevated-despite-stock-rally">Divergence #4: VIX Staying Elevated Despite Stock Rally</h3>

      <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPX rallying +3-5%</li>
        <li>VIX refuses to fall (stays above 20-25)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
      <p>Options market is NOT buying the rally. Put buyers still hedging aggressively despite higher stock prices. This signals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rally is short-covering (forced buying), not conviction buying</li>
        <li>Institutions using rally to hedge (buying puts while stocks up = cheap insurance)</li>
        <li>Reversal likely once short-covering exhausts</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Trading Rule:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPX +5% in week, VIX still &gt;22 = fade the rally (sell strength)</li>
        <li>Wait for VIX &lt;18 before trusting bullish continuation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="high-correlation-systemic-risk">High Correlation = Systemic Risk</h3>

      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When all asset classes move together (correlation → +1 or -1).</p>

      <p><strong>When It Happens:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Market crashes / forced liquidations (March 2020, October 2008)</li>
        <li>Systematic strategies unwinding (volatility targeting funds, risk parity funds)</li>
        <li>Margin calls / deleveraging events</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What Happens:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stocks fall, bonds fall, gold falls, crypto falls, commodities fall</li>
        <li><strong>Only USD cash rallies</strong> (flight to ultimate liquidity)</li>
        <li>Diversification FAILS (60/40 portfolios get crushed)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Example: March 2020 (COVID Crash)</strong></p>
      <pre style="background:rgba(255,71,71,.05);padding:1rem;border-radius:6px;overflow-x:auto">
<strong>March 9-12, 2020:</strong>
- SPY: -12%

- BTC (crypto): -25%

<strong>Correlation to SPY:</strong> Everything +0.9 correlation (all falling together)

<strong>Only winner:</strong> USD (DXY +4%)

<strong>Cause:</strong> Forced liquidation. Funds selling everything to raise cash.
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Trading Rule for High Correlation Regimes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Signal:</strong> SPY + TLT both down &gt;1% same day</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Exit ALL risk positions. Go to cash. Wait for correlations to normalize (usually 1-4 weeks).</li>
        <li><strong>Re-entry:</strong> When SPY up, TLT down (normal inverse correlation returns) = safe to re-enter risk.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="low-correlation-alpha-opportunity">Low Correlation = Alpha Opportunity</h3>

      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When assets trade on individual fundamentals (correlation → 0).</p>

      <p><strong>When It Happens:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Normal market environments (60-70% of time)</li>
        <li>Low volatility regimes (VIX &lt;18)</li>
        <li>Stock-picker markets (2017, 2019, H2 2023)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What Happens:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individual stocks trade on earnings, fundamentals, sector trends</li>
        <li>Some stocks up +10%, others down -10% (dispersion high)</li>
        <li>Active managers can generate alpha (outperform index)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Trading Strategy:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low correlation = increase position sizing:</strong> Stock-picking edge is highest. Go aggressive on high-conviction trades.</li>
        <li><strong>High correlation = reduce position sizing:</strong> Everything moving together = no edge. Go defensive, wait for regime shift.</li>

      <h3 id="daily-monitoring-routine-10-15-minutes">Daily Monitoring Routine (10-15 minutes)</h3>

      <p><strong>Step 1: Check Core Correlations</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPY vs TLT: Moving inversely (normal) or together (stress)?</li>
        <li>DXY: Breaking resistance (bearish SPX) or support (bullish SPX)?</li>
        <li>10Y yield: Rate of change &gt;20bps in week? (Volatility warning)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 2: Check Credit Market</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>HYG vs SPY: Aligned or diverging?</li>
        <li>HYG/SPY ratio: Making new 3-month low = bearish divergence</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 3: Check Commodities</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copper (HG or COPX): Falling while stocks rally = bearish</li>
        <li>Gold: Following dollar inverse correlation?</li>
        <li>Oil: Supply shock overriding fundamentals?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 4: Check Volatility</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>VIX: Elevated despite stock rally = fade rally</li>
        <li>CBOE Skew: &gt;150 = extreme fear (potential reversal)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 5: Use Signal Pilot Tools</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Janus Atlas:</strong> Overlay SPY, TLT, DXY, GLD on one chart → visual divergence detection</li>
        <li><strong>Pentarch Pilot Line:</strong> Check institutional order flow in bonds vs stocks</li>
        <li><strong>Plutus Flow:</strong> Unusual options activity in TLT, GLD, DXY (hedging signals)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stocks & bonds falling together = systemic risk</strong>—immediate exit signal (2008, March 2020 pattern)</li>
          <li><strong>Dollar strength = bearish for stocks</strong>—DXY breaking resistance is 2-4 week leading indicator for SPX weakness</li>
          <li><strong>Credit divergences are most reliable</strong>—when HYG falls while SPX rallies, credit is right 80% of time</li>
          <li><strong>Copper = global growth proxy</strong>—"Dr. Copper" falling + stocks rallying = bearish divergence</li>
          <li><strong>Yield rate of change matters</strong>—10Y spiking &gt;30 bps/week triggers SPX volatility</li>
          <li><strong>High correlation = reduce risk</strong>—when all assets move together, diversification fails, go to cash</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="practice-section">
        <h4>🎯 Practice Exercises</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Pull up TradingView. Plot SPY, TLT, DXY on same chart for last 6 months. Mark instances where SPY and TLT fell same day. What happened to SPY over next 2 weeks?</li>
          <li><strong>HYG/SPY Ratio Study:</strong> Calculate HYG/SPY ratio daily for last year. Mark when ratio made new 3-month low. Did SPX correct within next 4 weeks? Calculate hit rate.</li>
          <li><strong>Dollar Breakout Backtest:</strong> Find last 5 times DXY broke multi-month resistance (+3%). How did SPX perform over next 30 days? What was average drawdown?</li>
          <li><strong>Credit Divergence Hunt:</strong> Review 2022 bear market. When did HYG start falling relative to SPX? How many weeks did credit lead equities lower?</li>
          <li><strong>Build Your Checklist:</strong> Create daily spreadsheet tracking: SPY, TLT, DXY, HYG, Copper, VIX. Note when divergences appear. Track how long until divergence resolves.</li>
