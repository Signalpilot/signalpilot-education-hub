  <h1>Cross-Market Correlation: Reading The Full Picture</h1>
  <p><b>Stocks don't trade in a vacuum. Bonds, dollar, commodities—everything is connected.</b></p>
  <p>When the 10-year yield spikes 20 basis points in a day, SPX will react. When the dollar breaks support, gold will rally. Professional traders monitor these relationships constantly because they predict equity moves BEFORE they happen.</p>

  <h2>Part 1: The Big Four Correlations</h2>

  <h3>1. Stocks vs Bonds (SPY vs TLT)</h3>
  <p><strong>Normal correlation:</strong> Inverse (stocks up → bonds down)</p>
  <p><strong>Why:</strong> Risk-on = investors sell bonds, buy stocks; Risk-off = opposite</p>

        <th>Market State</th>
        <th>Stocks (SPY)</th>
        <th>Bonds (TLT)</th>

        <td>Risk-off</td>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>⚠️ Critical Signal:</strong> When stocks AND bonds fall together = systemic risk (margin calls, forced selling). Exit all risk immediately.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>2. Dollar vs Stocks (DXY vs SPX)</h3>
  <p><strong>Normal correlation:</strong> Inverse (dollar up → stocks down)</p>
  <p><strong>Why:</strong> Strong dollar = tighter financial conditions, pressure on multinationals (70% of SPX revenue is international)</p>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Why Dollar Strength Hurts Stocks</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Mechanism #1: Tighter financial conditions</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong dollar = global dollar liquidity contracts</li>
        <li>International borrowers struggle to repay dollar-denominated debt</li>
        <li>Risk of EM currency crises (2013 taper tantrum, 2015 China devaluation)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Mechanism #2: Earnings pressure</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SPX companies earn 30% of revenue internationally</li>
        <li>Strong dollar = foreign revenue worth less when converted back to USD</li>
        <li>Example: Apple earns €100M in Europe. If EUR/USD falls 10%, that €100M is now worth $10M less</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Trading rule:</strong> DXY breaking multi-month resistance = bearish for SPX (reduce long exposure)</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h3>3. Yields vs Stocks (10Y Yield vs SPX)</h3>
  <p><strong>Relationship is non-linear:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Yields 0-2%:</strong> Rising yields = bullish (recovery from recession)</li>
    <li><strong>Yields 2-4%:</strong> Neutral (goldilocks)</li>
    <li><strong>Yields &gt; 4%:</strong> Rising yields = bearish (bonds compete with stocks)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Rate of change matters:</strong> +10bps/day = manageable, +30bps/day = panic</p>

  <h3>4. Commodities vs Dollar (Gold, Oil vs DXY)</h3>
  <p><strong>Gold vs Dollar:</strong> Strong inverse correlation (dollar down → gold up)</p>
  <p><strong>Oil vs Dollar:</strong> Moderate inverse correlation (oil priced in dollars)</p>
  <p><strong>Why:</strong> Commodities priced in USD → weaker dollar = commodity prices rise in dollar terms</p>

  <h2>Part 2: Intermarket Divergences (Leading Indicators)</h2>

  <h3>What Is a Divergence?</h3>
  <p><strong>Divergence:</strong> When correlated assets break their normal relationship</p>
  <p><strong>Signal:</strong> One asset is telling you something the other hasn't priced in yet</p>

  <h3>Key Divergences to Watch</h3>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Divergence #1: Stocks Up, Bonds Not Falling</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> SPX making new highs, but TLT not making new lows</p>
      <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Bond market skeptical of equity rally (maybe rally is low-quality, narrow breadth)</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> Bearish signal for stocks. Either bonds are wrong (rare) or stocks will follow bonds lower (common)</p>
      <p><strong>Signal Pilot tool:</strong> Use Janus Atlas to check if SPX rally has breadth or just a few mega-caps</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Divergence #2: High-Yield Spreads Widening, Stocks Rallying</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> SPX making new highs, but HYG (junk bonds) falling / spreads widening</p>
      <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Credit market smells trouble (defaults coming, recession risk)</p>
      <p><strong>Why it leads:</strong> Credit investors are smarter than equity investors (bondholders get paid first in bankruptcy → more careful)</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> Major bearish divergence. Reduce equity exposure, buy puts.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Divergence #3: Copper Falling, Stocks Rallying</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> SPX making new highs, copper (Dr. Copper) falling</p>
      <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Industrial demand weakening (global growth slowing)</p>
      <p><strong>Why copper leads:</strong> Copper has a PhD in economics (used in construction, manufacturing, EVs)</p>
      <p><strong>Trade:</strong> Bearish for cyclical stocks (XLI, materials, energy). Defensive rotation coming.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h2>Part 3: Correlation Regimes</h2>

  <h3>High Correlation = Danger</h3>
  <p><strong>When:</strong> Market stress, forced liquidations, systematic strategies unwinding</p>
  <p><strong>What happens:</strong> All assets move together (diversification fails)</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> March 2020 — stocks, bonds, gold, crypto ALL fell together (only USD rallied)</p>

  <h3>Low Correlation = Opportunity</h3>
  <p><strong>When:</strong> Normal markets, stock-picking environment</p>
  <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Individual assets trade on fundamentals (alpha opportunity)</p>
  <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> High correlation → reduce risk, wait for reset. Low correlation → increase position sizing, hunt alpha.</p>

  <h2>Part 4: Using Signal Pilot for Intermarket Analysis</h2>

  <h3>Janus Atlas: Multi-Asset View</h3>
  <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Overlay SPY, TLT, DXY, GLD on same chart</p>
  <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Divergences (stocks making new high, dollar not making new low)</p>

  <h3>Pentarch Pilot Line: Cross-Asset Order Flow</h3>
  <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Check if institutional order flow in bonds aligns with stocks</p>
  <p><strong>Signal:</strong> If bond order flow turns defensive while stocks rally → divergence warning</p>

  <h3>Plutus Flow: Unusual Cross-Asset Options Activity</h3>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Massive TLT call buying + SPY put buying = institutions hedging for risk-off event</p>

  <h2>Quiz: Test Your Understanding</h2>
  <div class="quiz">
    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q1:</strong> SPX rallies 2%, but TLT also rallies 1%. What does this signal?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bullish for risk assets (Fed easing environment). Both stocks and bonds rising = liquidity injection (QE). This is a BUY signal for equities as long as it persists.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q2:</strong> SPX making new highs, but HYG (high-yield bonds) falling. What action do you take?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bearish divergence. Credit market pricing in recession risk while equity investors complacent. Reduce equity exposure, buy puts, or hedge. Credit leads equities—when they diverge, credit is usually right.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q3:</strong> DXY (dollar index) breaks 6-month resistance. How do you adjust your SPX position?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bearish for SPX. Strong dollar = tighter financial conditions + multinational earnings pressure. Reduce long exposure or add hedges. If DXY continues higher, SPX will face headwinds.</p>
      </details>

  <h2>Practical Checklist</h2>
  <div class="checklist">
    <h4>Daily Intermarket Review:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check SPY vs TLT: Are they moving inversely (normal) or together (extreme)?</li>
      <li>Check DXY: Breaking resistance (bearish SPX) or support (bullish SPX)?</li>
      <li>Check 10Y yield rate of change: &gt;20bps in single day = volatility incoming</li>
      <li>Check HYG vs SPY: Credit diverging from equities?</li>
      <li>Check copper: Falling while stocks rally = bearish divergence</li>
      <li>Use Janus Atlas to overlay multi-asset charts for visual divergence detection</li>
      <li>Check Plutus Flow for unusual TLT/GLD/DXY options activity (hedging signals)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="key-takeaway">
