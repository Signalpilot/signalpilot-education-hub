## üü¢ BEGINNER TIER - COMPLETE OVERVIEW

### Category: Market Structure Reality

#### 1. **The Liquidity Lie: Why Support & Resistance is a Trap** ‚úÖ
**Length:** ~2,400 words | **Status:** Complete

You've been trading against yourself. Every stop below support is liquidity for smart money. Learn:
- Why support/resistance lines are retail traps
- Sweep mechanics and how institutions hunt stops
- Liquidity engineering fundamentals
- Janus Atlas liquidity sweep detection
- How to trade WITH institutional flow

**Key Takeaway:** Support doesn't "hold" ‚Äî it's broken to harvest your stops.

---

#### 2. **Volume Doesn't Lie, But You're Reading It Wrong** ‚úÖ
**Length:** ~5,100 words | **Status:** Complete

Volume bars show quantity, not quality. Two candles with identical volume can have opposite implications. Learn:
- Delta analysis: Buy volume vs. sell volume
- Absorption vs. exhaustion patterns
- Plutus Flow spike-clipped OBV methodology
- Volume Profile: POC, Value Area, HVN/LVN
- Why low-volume moves can be stronger than high-volume spikes

---

#### 3. **Price Action is Dead: Long Live Order Flow** ‚úÖ
**Length:** ~5,700 words | **Status:** Complete

Candlesticks show WHERE price traded, not HOW or WHY. Learn:
- Time & Sales tape reading fundamentals
- Footprint charts: Volume at price
- Aggressive vs. passive order flow
- Iceberg detection and institutional footprints
- Integrating order flow with Volume Oracle regime detection

**Key Takeaway:** Price tells you where you are. Order flow tells you where you're going.

### Category: Indicator Truth

#### 4. **Your Indicators Are Lying to You (The Repaint Problem)** ‚úÖ
**Length:** ~4,800 words | **Status:** Complete

- What repainting is and why it's so prevalent
- 4 methods to detect repainting in any indicator
- Signal Pilot's deterministic protocol
- HTF repainting vs. future data repainting
- Complete indicator audit framework

**Key Takeaway:** Backtest perfection often means real-time failure.

---

#### 5. **RSI Extremes Are Not Reversal Signals** üìù
**Planned Length:** ~2,500 words | **Status:** In Development

- Why overbought can stay overbought (momentum regimes)
- RSI as filter, not trigger
- Harmonic Oscillator voting system
- When RSI extremes DO matter (ranging regimes)

**Key Takeaway:** Context determines if overbought means reversal or continuation.

---

#### 6. **Moving Averages: The Most Misunderstood Tool** üìù
**Planned Length:** ~2,800 words | **Status:** In Development

EMAs aren't support/resistance‚Äîthey're trend filters. Learn:
- Why the Golden Cross lags too much
- Multi-timeframe EMA alignment (the right way)
- EMAs as regime filters, not entry triggers
- Pentarch Pilot Line methodology
- Dynamic vs. static support concepts

**Key Takeaway:** EMAs describe trend; they don't predict reversals.

### Category: Psychology Foundations

#### 7. **Why You Keep Revenge Trading (And How to Stop)** üìù
**Planned Length:** ~2,600 words | **Status:** In Development

- Loss aversion and the amygdala response
- 3 warning signs of tilt
- Circuit breaker rules that actually work
- Pre-trade mental state assessment
- Daily mental preparation checklist

**Key Takeaway:** You can't willpower your way out of tilt. You need systems.

---

#### 8. **Confirmation Bias is Killing Your P&L** üìù
**Planned Length:** ~2,400 words | **Status:** In Development

**Key Takeaway:** Right position size turns edge into profit. Wrong size turns edge into ruin.

#### 10. **Stop Losses Don't Protect You (If Placed Wrong)** üìù
**Planned Length:** ~2,700 words | **Status:** In Development
