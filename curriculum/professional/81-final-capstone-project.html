    <h4>The Moment of Truth</h4>
    <p>Everything up to this point has been preparation. You've absorbed concepts, studied examples, learned frameworks. But knowledge without implementation is worthless. This capstone project forces you to make DECISIONS: Which strategy? What risk rules? How will you actually execute? Completing this transforms you from student to practitioner. Your trading plan becomes your business plan—the document you'll follow for the next 12-24 months as you build your edge.</p>

          <p>Don't overwhelm yourself. Start with these 3 actions:</p>
          <ol style="margin:0.75rem 0 0 1.5rem;line-height:1.8">
            <li><strong>Create Your "One-Page Strategy Blueprint" Tonight (Forces YOU to Define Every Rule BEFORE Trading a Single Dollar)</strong> — Amanda Torres lost $38,200 over 10 months (March-December 2024) trading with "vibes" instead of written rules. She'd see a setup, think "this looks good," enter, then panic-sell when it went against her. No written entry criteria. No written stop loss rules. No written exit plan. Just improvisation. Result: 157 trades, 62 wins (39% win rate), -$38,200 total loss. The problem? Without a written plan, she second-guessed EVERY decision. "Should I take this trade? Where's my stop? When do I exit?" Every trade was a new debate. The fix: Write down EVERY rule before trading. January 2025: Amanda created a "One-Page Strategy Blueprint" with 6 sections in a simple template: (1) Strategy Name & Type (e.g., "Opening Range Breakout - Momentum"), (2) Entry Criteria (EXACT rules: "SPY breaks above 9:30 AM high + volume > 2× 10-day average + positive cumulative delta"), (3) Stop Loss (EXACT placement: "1 tick below opening range low OR -1.5%, whichever is tighter"), (4) Profit Target (EXACT exit: "First target: +2R at resistance. Trail remaining 50% with 15-min 20 EMA"), (5) Trade Filters (When NOT to trade: "VIX > 30, major news events, low volume days < 50M SPY"), (6) Risk Management (Position size: 1% risk per trade, max 3 trades open, daily loss limit -2%). Once written, she printed it and taped it next to her monitor. Result (Jan-April 2025): 68 trades, 47 wins (69% win rate), +$24,800 profit. Same setups she used to lose on—but now with RULES. Why it worked: No more second-guessing. Every decision pre-made. Entry? Check the blueprint. Stop? Check the blueprint. Exit? Check the blueprint. Zero emotional decisions. Tonight's action: Open a Google Doc titled "My Trading Strategy Blueprint." Fill in 6 sections: (1) Strategy Name & Type (what's your main setup?), (2) Entry Criteria (be SPECIFIC—what 3-5 conditions must be met?), (3) Stop Loss (where exactly do you place it? Fixed $ amount? Below support?), (4) Profit Target (do you take profit at fixed R-multiple? Trail stops? Scale out?), (5) Trade Filters (when do you NOT take the trade even if setup is perfect? High VIX? News events?), (6) Risk Management (1% risk per trade? Max open positions? Daily loss limit?). Keep it to ONE PAGE. Print it. Tape it to your monitor. Tomorrow, before EVERY trade, check: "Does this setup meet ALL my blueprint criteria?" If yes → enter. If no → skip. This single document prevents 80% of emotional/impulsive trades.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtest Your Strategy on 20 Historical Setups This Week (Validates Your Edge BEFORE Risking Real Money)</strong> — Marcus Chen lost $41,600 over 7 months (February-August 2024) trading a strategy he NEVER backtested. He read about "VWAP mean reversion" on Twitter, thought it sounded good, and immediately started trading it with real money. The problem: He had no idea if it actually worked. February-August 2024: 94 trades, 38 wins (40% win rate), -$41,600 loss. The strategy had NO EDGE. He was gambling. September 2024 lesson learned: Backtest BEFORE trading. He went back through 6 months of charts, found 50 historical "VWAP mean reversion" setups, and tracked outcomes. Result: Win rate 34%, profit factor 0.8 (losing strategy). The strategy NEVER had an edge. He wasted $41,600 and 7 months discovering what 2 hours of backtesting would've shown. The fix: Test your strategy on 20+ historical examples BEFORE live trading. Tonight's action: Open your charting platform (TradingView, ThinkorSwim, etc.). Go back 3-6 months in history. Find 20 instances where your strategy setup appeared. For each setup: (1) Take a screenshot of the setup (entry point, stop loss, target), (2) Mark where you would've entered, (3) Mark where your stop loss would've been, (4) Track the outcome: Did it hit your target? Hit your stop? What was the R-multiple (profit/loss ÷ risk)? Log all 20 in a spreadsheet with columns: Date, Ticker, Entry Price, Stop Price, Target Price, Outcome (Win/Loss), R-Multiple, Notes. After 20 setups, calculate: Win rate (# wins ÷ 20), Average R-multiple (sum of all R-multiples ÷ 20), Profit factor (total R from wins ÷ total R from losses). If win rate > 55% AND profit factor > 1.5 → Your strategy has potential. Proceed to paper trading. If win rate < 50% OR profit factor < 1.2 → Your strategy has NO EDGE. Do NOT trade it. Find a different approach. This 2-hour exercise saves you from losing $20K-$50K on an unproven strategy. Marcus now backtests EVERY strategy before trading. He's saved himself from 4 losing strategies (and $60K+ in prevented losses) by killing them in backtesting instead of with real money.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Your "20-Trade Paper Trading Journal" Tomorrow (Proves You Can Execute Your System BEFORE Risking Capital)</strong> — Sophie Martinez lost $29,800 in her first 30 days of live trading (October 2024) because she skipped paper trading and went straight to real money. She had a strategy (backtested, looked good on paper), but she'd NEVER actually executed it in real-time. October 1-30: She took 47 trades. Broke her rules on 31 of them. Why? (1) Hesitated on entries (missed 12 perfect setups because she "wasn't sure"), (2) Moved stops (14 trades where she widened her stop "just a little" to avoid getting stopped out—all became bigger losses), (3) Took profits too early (9 trades where she exited at +1R instead of her plan's +3R target because she "got scared"), (4) Revenge traded (6 trades taken purely to "make back" morning losses). Result: 47 trades, 18 wins (38% win rate), -$29,800 loss. NOT because the strategy was bad, but because she couldn't execute it. November 2024 reset: Sophie opened a paper trading account. Goal: 20 consecutive trades following her rules PERFECTLY. No rule breaks. No hesitation. No emotional overrides. It took her 6 weeks to get 20 clean trades. By trade 20, she had internalized the process: "This is my entry, this is my stop, this is my target. I don't move them." December 2024-March 2025 (live trading): 78 trades, 54 wins (69% win rate), +$31,200 profit. Same strategy, same person—but now with EXECUTION discipline proven through paper trading. Tonight's action: Open a paper trading account (most brokers offer free paper accounts: TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim, TradeStation, Webull, TradingView). Start tomorrow with ONE goal: Execute 20 trades following your strategy blueprint PERFECTLY. Zero rule breaks. For each trade, log in your journal: (1) Date/Time, (2) Setup (screenshot), (3) Entry price (did I hesitate or enter per plan?), (4) Stop loss (did I move it or keep it per plan?), (5) Exit (did I take profit early or follow plan?), (6) Rule adherence (Yes/No—did I follow ALL rules?), (7) Outcome (Win/Loss/Breakeven). The goal is NOT to make paper profits. The goal is to PROVE you can execute your system without emotional interference. After 20 trades, review: "How many trades did I execute PERFECTLY per my rules?" If 18+/20 (90%+) → You're ready for small live size. If < 15/20 (< 75%) → Keep paper trading until you hit 90% rule adherence. This discipline separates profitable traders (who execute their plan) from losing traders (who break their rules under pressure). Sophie's advice: "I lost $29,800 in one month because I skipped paper trading. I thought I was 'ready.' I wasn't. It took 6 weeks of paper trading to prove I could execute my system without panicking, hesitating, or revenge trading. Those 6 weeks of paper saved me from another $50K+ in live losses. Don't skip this step."</li>

  <h3 id="section-11-market-selection">Section 1.1: Market Selection</h3>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>Questions to Answer:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Which markets will you trade?</strong> (Stocks, futures, forex, crypto, options?)</li>
      <li><strong>Why these markets?</strong> (Liquidity, hours, capital requirements, familiarity?)</li>
      <li><strong>Which specific instruments?</strong> (E.g., "Only S&P 500 stocks above $20, avg volume 1M+, or ES/NQ futures")</li>
      <li><strong>Will you trade all sessions?</strong> (Pre-market, regular hours, after-hours?)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>"I trade U.S. large-cap equities exclusively—S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 components with minimum $50 price, 2M+ avg daily volume, and market cap over $10B. This ensures sufficient liquidity for my $25K-100K account size and minimizes slippage. I only trade regular hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET) to avoid low-liquidity environments. I do NOT trade pre-market or after-hours."</em></p>

<h3 id="section-12-trading-style-timeframe">Section 1.2: Trading Style & Timeframe</h3>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>Questions to Answer:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What's your holding period?</strong> (Scalping: seconds-minutes, Day: hours, Swing: days-weeks, Position: weeks-months)</li>
      <li><strong>What's your primary timeframe for analysis?</strong> (1-min, 5-min, hourly, daily?)</li>
      <li><strong>What's your confirmation timeframe?</strong> (Higher timeframe for context)</li>
      <li><strong>Why this timeframe fits YOU?</strong> (Available time, temperament, capital)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>"I am a swing trader holding positions 3-10 days. My primary analysis timeframe is daily charts (identify setups), with 4-hour charts for potential entry timing, and weekly charts for trend context. This fits my schedule (full-time job, can only check markets 2 hours/day) and temperament (patient, comfortable with overnight risk, prefer fewer high-quality trades over high-frequency trading)."</em></p>

  </div>
<h3 id="section-13-strategy-type-setup-criteria">Section 1.3: Strategy Type & Setup Criteria</h3>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>Define Your Core Strategy (Pick 1-2):</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breakout:</strong> Enter when price breaks above/below key level with volume</li>
      <li><strong>Mean Reversion:</strong> Fade extremes, buy oversold, sell overbought</li>
      <li><strong>Momentum:</strong> Buy strength, sell weakness, ride trends</li>
      <li><strong>Range Trading:</strong> Buy support, sell resistance in consolidation</li>
      <li><strong>Event-Driven:</strong> Trade earnings, economic data, news catalysts</li>
      <li><strong>Pairs Trading:</strong> Long/short correlated assets when spread diverges</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Setup Criteria (MUST BE SPECIFIC):</h4>
    <p>List EXACT conditions that must be met. No discretion allowed.</p>

    <h4>Example (Breakout Strategy):</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Setup name:</strong> Multi-Timeframe Breakout with Volume Confirmation</p>
      <p><strong>Entry criteria (ALL must be true):</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Daily chart: Price consolidating at resistance for 5+ days in tight range (ATR &lt; 1.5× 20-day avg)</li>
        <li>Weekly chart: Above 50-week EMA (long-term uptrend intact)</li>
        <li>4-hour chart: Higher lows forming during consolidation (coiling pressure)</li>
        <li>Breakout trigger: 15-min candle closes above resistance level with volume 2×+ avg</li>
        <li>Confirmation: No immediate resistance within 3% above potential breakout level</li>
        <li>Order flow: Pentarch Pilot Line green (institutional accumulation) OR dark pool prints 50K+ shares at support</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Entry execution:</strong> Buy on close of 15-min confirmation candle, or next candle open (no chasing)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
<h3 id="section-14-stop-loss-placement">Section 1.4: Stop Loss Placement</h3>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>Stop Loss Formula (Choose ONE, apply consistently):</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ATR-based:</strong> 2× ATR(14) below potential entry (adapts to volatility)</li>
      <li><strong>Technical level:</strong> Below recent swing low or support zone</li>
      <li><strong>Fixed percentage:</strong> -2% from potential entry (simple but inflexible)</li>
      <li><strong>Time-based:</strong> If no progress in X days, potential exit (for swing trades)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>"My stop loss is placed at the lower of: (a) 1.5× ATR(14) below potential entry, OR (b) $0.10 below recent swing low that defined potential breakout level. This ensures I'm out if potential breakout fails, while giving trade room to breathe based on volatility. Maximum stop distance: 3% from potential entry (override formula if wider)."</em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
<h3 id="section-15-profit-targets-potential exit-rules">Section 1.5: Profit Targets & Exit Rules</h3>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>Target Strategy (Choose ONE or hybrid):</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fixed R-multiple:</strong> Exit at 2R, 3R, or 5R (R = initial risk)</li>
      <li><strong>Technical targets:</strong> Next resistance, measured move, Fibonacci extension</li>
      <li><strong>Trailing stop:</strong> Move stop to protect profits as trade moves in your favor</li>
      <li><strong>Scaling out:</strong> Take partial profits at targets, trail remainder</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example (Scaling Strategy):</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>"I scale out in thirds: (1) Exit 33% at 2R, move stop to breakeven on remaining 67%. (2) Exit 33% at 3.5R, trail stop on final 34% to -$0.50 below each new hourly high. (3) Final 34% rides until trailed stop hit or 7R reached (whichever first). This ensures I lock profits early while giving winners room to run."</em></p>
    </blockquote>

<h3 id="section-16-trade-filters-invalidation-rules">Section 1.6: Trade Filters & Invalidation Rules</h3>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>When NOT to Trade (Market Conditions):</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High volatility:</strong> VIX &gt; 30 (choppy, stops get hit more)</li>
      <li><strong>Low volatility:</strong> VIX &lt; 12 (ranges too tight, limited profit potential)</li>
      <li><strong>Against broader market:</strong> Don't long breakouts when SPY below 200-day MA</li>
      <li><strong>Earnings week:</strong> Avoid trading stocks with earnings in next 5 days (unpredictable gaps)</li>
      <li><strong>Economic data:</strong> Sit out 30 min before/after major data (FOMC, NFP, CPI)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>"I do NOT take new positions when: (1) VIX &gt; 25 (breakouts fail in extreme volatility), (2) Stock has earnings in next 3 days, (3) SPY below 200-day MA (my strategy requires bull market), (4) First/last 15 minutes of trading day (choppy), (5) Major economic data releases (10 AM CPI, 2 PM FOMC)."</em></p>

  <h3 id="section-21-position-sizing-formula">Section 2.1: Position Sizing Formula</h3>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>Fixed Fractional Method (Recommended for Beginners):</h4>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Position Size = (Account Size × Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Price)</p>

    <h4>Example Calculation:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Account size: $50,000</li>
      <li>Risk per trade: 1% = $500</li>
      <li>Entry price: $100</li>
      <li>Stop price: $97 (risk per share = $3)</li>
      <li><strong>Position size:</strong> $500 / $3 = 166 shares</li>
      <li><strong>Position value:</strong> 166 × $100 = $16,600 (33% of account, but only risking 1%)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Your Risk Per Trade:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conservative:</strong> 0.5% (can survive 200 consecutive losses)</li>
      <li><strong>Standard:</strong> 1.0% (can survive 100 consecutive losses)</li>
      <li><strong>Aggressive:</strong> 2.0% (can survive 50 consecutive losses—risky)</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section-detail">
    <h4>Definition:</h4>
    <p>Sum of all open position risks. Prevents over-concentration.</p>

    <h4>Example Rules:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Max 3-5 positions open simultaneously</strong> (5 positions × 1% risk each = 5% portfolio heat)</li>
      <li><strong>Max 6% total portfolio heat</strong> (if 3 positions at 1% each, can add 3% more risk across 3 new positions)</li>
      <li><strong>Correlated positions count double</strong> (2 positions in same sector = higher real risk)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Document your limits:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>"Maximum 4 positions open at once. Maximum 5% portfolio heat (sum of all position risks). If I have 4 positions at 1% each (4% heat), I cannot add new positions until one closes. If trades move to breakeven (risk eliminated), I can add new positions."</em></p>

    <h4>Common Limits:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>-2% daily loss:</strong> Stop trading for the day, review what went wrong</li>
      <li><strong>-3 consecutive losses:</strong> Stop trading for the day (regardless of dollar amount)</li>

      <p><em>"If I lose 2% of my account in a single day, I immediately stop trading and close my terminal. No exceptions.

    <h4>Real-World Example: Dan's $14K "Skipped Capstone" Failure</h4>

    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Dan, a 29-year-old software engineer, completed all 82 SignalPilot lessons over 5 months (January-May 2024). He absorbed every concept: Janus sweeps, Plutus Flow, Volume Oracle, footprint reading, risk management formulas. He scored 90%+ on all quizzes. He felt READY. But when he reached Lesson 81 (Final Capstone Project), he thought: <em>"I know the concepts—I don't need to write a 20-page trading plan or backtest for weeks. That's busy work. I'll just start trading."</em> In March 2024, he deposited $30,000 and went live immediately. No written plan. No backtest. No paper trading. No risk limits documented. Over 3 months (March-May 2024), he lost <strong>$14,200 (47% drawdown)</strong>. By June 1, his account stood at $15,800. What went wrong? Dan traded "by feel" using concepts from lessons but with ZERO systematic framework. He learned WHAT to look for (sweeps, flow, volume) but never defined HOW to combine them into a repeatable system. The result: discretionary chaos masquerading as trading.</p>

    <h5>The Pattern: Concepts Without System = Discretionary Gambling</h5>

    <p>Dan's 12 trades show a devastating pattern: <strong>He KNEW the concepts but had NO SYSTEM to apply them.</strong> Every trade had a "signal" (sweep, flow, volume), but zero confluence checks, no filters, no risk limits, no emotional circuit breakers. He learned WHAT to look for but never defined:</p><ul>
      <li><strong>HOW MANY signals must align?</strong> (1 green indicator ≠ potential entry. Need 3-4 confluence checks.)</li>
      <li><strong>WHEN NOT to trade?</strong> (VIX &gt; 25, earnings week, FOMC, negative news, bear market regime)</li>
      <li><strong>HOW MUCH to risk?</strong> (He risked 5-9% per trade vs 1% rule = magnified losses 5-9×)</li>
      <li><strong>WHAT TO DO when wrong?</strong> (He moved stops 4 times, hoping for recovery = lost extra $3.8K)</li>
      <li><strong>WHEN TO STOP?</strong> (No daily loss limit, no drawdown pause, revenge-traded from -40% to -47%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Capstone Would Have Forced:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Written Plan:</strong> "I only take Janus sweeps when Volume Oracle confirms + SPY above 200MA + VIX &lt; 25 + no earnings within 3 days. ALL must be TRUE." → Dan would have skipped 8/12 trades.</li>
      <li><strong>Backtest:</strong> Testing his "trade every sweep" approach over 150 historical trades would have revealed 38% win rate, -0.4 expectancy → UNPROFITABLE. He would have refined BEFORE losing $14K.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Framework:</strong> "Risk exactly 1% per trade. Max 4 positions. Max 5% portfolio heat." → His average loss would have been -$300 instead of -$1,290.</li>
      <li><strong>Paper Trading:</strong> 20-30 paper trades would have revealed his stop-moving habit and revenge trading tendency in ZERO-RISK environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Drawdown Protocol:</strong> "At -15%, reduce size 50%. At -20%, pause trading." → Dan would have stopped at -$6K instead of bleeding to -$14.2K.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Dan's Recovery: The Capstone Journey</h5>

    <p><strong>After -47% drawdown ($30K → $15.8K),</strong> Dan admitted defeat and completed the capstone properly over 6 weeks:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Week 1-2: Strategy Definition (22 pages):</strong> Defined exact potential entry criteria (Janus sweep + Volume Oracle green + SPY above 200MA + VIX &lt; 25 + no earnings &lt; 3 days + ATR &gt; 1.5× avg). Stop loss: 1.5× ATR or swing low. Target: 2.5R scale-out strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 3-4: Backtest (150 trades, 2019-2024):</strong> Results: 64% win rate, 1.8:1 R:R, Sharpe 1.4, max DD 12%. Profit factor 2.1. <em>Positive expectancy confirmed.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Week 5: Risk Framework:</strong> 1% risk per trade, max 4 positions, 5% portfolio heat, -2% daily loss limit, -15% drawdown pause rule.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 6: Paper Trading (25 trades):</strong> 68% win rate, 2.1R avg, 88% rule adherence. Emotional discipline tested—no stop violations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Phase 1 Live Trading (0.5% risk, 4 months):</strong> Dan returned to live trading in July 2024 with <strong>$15,800 capital</strong> and strict Phase 1 rules (0.5% risk = $79 per trade). Results over 18 trades: 72% win rate (13 wins, 5 losses), +$4,820 profit (30% gain). Same trader. Same markets. Systematic approach. The capstone bridged theory to execution.</p>

    <p><b>The lesson: Dan knew Janus sweeps, Plutus Flow, Volume Oracle, footprint reading, risk management FORMULAS—all the CONCEPTS from 82 lessons. But without a capstone SYSTEM (written plan with confluence rules, backtest proving edge, paper trading building discipline, scaling plan preventing overconfidence), he gambled. The capstone isn't busy work—it's the filtration system that turns 100 "signals" into 8 high-probability setups. It's the circuit breaker that stops -15% from becoming -47%. It's the bridge from student to professional. Dan's -$14K lesson: Complete the capstone. Your future self will thank you.</b></p>

    <h4>Capstone Completion Checklist</h4>
    <p><strong>You're ready to move forward when you can answer "YES" to ALL:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ I have a written trading plan (20+ pages) documenting strategy, risk rules, execution workflow</li>
      <li>✅ My strategy has positive expectancy over 100+ backtested trades</li>
      <li>✅ I understand WHY my edge exists and why it should persist</li>
      <li>✅ My risk management framework limits max drawdown to &lt; 20%</li>
      <li>✅ I have documented, specific rules with zero discretion allowed</li>
      <li>✅ I paper-traded 20+ trades following rules 90%+ of time</li>
      <li>✅ My Sharpe ratio &gt; 1.0 in both backtest AND paper trading</li>
      <li>✅ I can explain my edge in 2 sentences ("I profit because ___")</li>
      <li>✅ I have a performance tracking system (journal + dashboard)</li>
      <li>✅ I'm committed to 18-24 month scaling plan (not rushing to full size)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<p style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:500;margin:2rem 0">The capstone isn't busywork—it's the bridge from student to professional. 80 lessons of theory mean nothing without a systematic plan. Document, backtest, paper trade, scale slowly. Most traders skip this. You won't.</p>

  <div class="final-message">
    <h2 id="final-words-this-is-where-winners-are-made">Final Words: This Is Where Winners Are Made</h2>
    <p>Most traders skip this step. They learn concepts, watch videos, read books—but never synthesize it into a SYSTEM. They wing it, trade discretionally, blow up, and quit.</p>
    <p><strong>You're different.</strong> By completing this capstone, you're building the foundation of a sustainable trading career.</p>
    <p><strong>Your trading plan is your business plan.</strong> Treat it seriously. Revise quarterly. Update as markets evolve. But once finalized, FOLLOW IT. Trust the process. Patience compounds capital.</p>
