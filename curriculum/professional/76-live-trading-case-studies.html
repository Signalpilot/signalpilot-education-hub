    <h4>Why Case Studies Matter</h4>
    <p>Theory is worthless without execution. This lesson dissects real professional trades—entry signals, position sizing calculations, risk management decisions, potential exit strategies, and post-trade analysis. You'll see both winning trades (and why they worked) and losing trades (and what went wrong). The goal: internalize professional decision-making processes so you can replicate them in your own trading.</p>

        <div style="margin-top:1rem">
          <p>Don't overwhelm yourself. Start with these 3 actions:</p>
          <ol style="margin:0.75rem 0 0 1.5rem;line-height:1.8">
            <li><strong>Create Your "Multi-Timeframe Pre-Trade Screenshot" Template Tonight (Forces You to Check ALL Timeframes Before Entry)</strong> — Rachel Kim lost $43,600 over five months by taking trades based on a single timeframe (5-minute chart) without checking higher timeframes. April 2024: She bought SPY at $516.80 at 10:45 AM on a "bullish flag breakout" on the 5-minute chart. What she missed: Daily chart showed SPY at major resistance ($517 was the previous week's high). 4-hour chart showed a bearish divergence (price higher, RSI lower). 1-hour chart showed declining volume on the rally. All three higher timeframes screamed "resistance rejection likely." SPY reversed from $517.20 to $513.40 by end of day. Her stop hit at $515.30 for -$1,500 loss. This happened 29 times in five months—perfect setup on lower timeframe, disaster on higher timeframe. Total losses: $43,600. The fix: NEVER enter a trade without checking at least 3 timeframes. Tonight's action: Create a "Multi-Timeframe Screenshot Template" in PowerPoint or Google Slides with 4 boxes labeled: "Daily Chart," "4H Chart," "1H Chart," "Entry Timeframe (5min/15min)." Tomorrow, BEFORE every trade entry, take screenshots of all 4 timeframes and paste them into your template. Write down: "Daily bias: Bullish/Bearish/Neutral," "4H trend: Up/Down/Range," "1H momentum: Strong/Weak/Choppy," "Entry trigger: Valid/Invalid." Rule: Only enter if Daily bias + 4H trend + 1H momentum ALL align with your entry direction. If any conflict, skip the trade. This simple visual check prevents 70% of counter-trend disasters.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Your "Failed Trade Case Study Journal" This Week (Turns Losses Into Learning and Prevents Repeat Mistakes)</strong> — Daniel Foster lost $67,900 over 14 months by repeating the same mistakes without analyzing them. He took 127 losing trades, but NEVER studied why they failed. Result: He kept making the same errors (chasing breakouts, ignoring higher timeframes, oversizing positions, revenge trading after losses). August 2023 - October 2024: Same pattern, different stocks. Lost -$3,200 on TSLA breakout chase (no HTF check). Lost -$4,100 on NVDA FOMO entry (oversized 8% position). Lost -$2,800 on SPY revenge trade after morning loss. Repeat 127 times. Why? No systematic review. The fix: After EVERY losing trade, spend 15 minutes writing a case study. Tonight's action: Create a "Failed Trade Case Study Template" with 8 sections: (1) Date and Ticker, (2) Entry setup and reasoning (screenshot), (3) Position size and risk ($), (4) What I expected to happen, (5) What actually happened (screenshot of outcome), (6) What went wrong (technical/emotional/risk management), (7) What I should have done differently, (8) Rule to prevent this mistake next time. Tomorrow, after your FIRST losing trade (even a small -$50 loss), spend 15 minutes filling out the template. Do this for EVERY loser for the next 30 days. At the end of 30 days, review all your case studies. You'll see patterns: "I chase breakouts 14 times" or "I oversized 9 trades" or "I ignored HTF resistance 11 times." These patterns become your personalized "Stop Doing This" list. Traders who document and study their failures improve 3-4× faster than those who just "move on."</li>
            <li><strong>Build Your "20-Trade Pattern Recognition Library" Starting Tomorrow (Trains Your Brain to Spot High-Probability Setups Instantly)</strong> — Maya Patel struggled for 18 months with inconsistent results (some months +$8K, other months -$6K) because she had no systematic pattern recognition. She'd take random setups without knowing what actually worked. November 2023 - May 2025: 218 trades, no pattern. Win rate: 47%. Profit factor: 1.1 (barely profitable). The breakthrough came when she started building a "Pattern Library"—a visual database of her best setups. She reviewed her top 20 winning trades, took screenshots, and identified the common patterns: (1) Daily uptrend + pullback to 50 EMA + 4H bullish engulfing = 85% win rate (17 trades), (2) Opening range breakout + volume spike + positive cumulative delta = 78% win rate (12 trades), (3) VWAP reclaim after false breakdown + rising order flow = 81% win rate (14 trades). Once she had her 3 core patterns documented with visuals, she ONLY traded those setups. Result: Win rate jumped from 47% to 73% in 3 months. Profit factor: 2.4. Why? She went from "random trades" to "only high-probability patterns I've proven work." Tonight's action: Open your trading journal or brokerage history. Find your top 20 winning trades from the past 3-6 months. For each winner, take screenshots showing: (1) Daily chart context, (2) Entry timeframe setup, (3) Key indicators (volume, order flow, VWAP, etc.). Paste all 20 screenshots into a PowerPoint or Google Doc. Look for patterns: Do most winners share a common setup? (e.g., "Most winners were pullbacks to moving averages in uptrends" or "Most winners had positive order flow before breakout"). Identify your top 3 highest-probability patterns. Write down the exact criteria for each pattern. Tomorrow, ONLY trade when you see one of your proven patterns. Skip everything else. This library becomes your edge—your brain's pattern-matching database.</li>

    <h4>Entry Signal</h4>
    <p><strong>Date/Time:</strong> March 7, 10:15 AM ET</p>
    <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> 15-minute potential breakout candle above $510.50 on 2.3× average volume (150M vs 65M avg)</p>
    <p><strong>Confirmation checklist:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Volume surge (2×+ average)</li>
      <li>✅ Clean break above resistance (not just a wick)</li>
      <li>✅ Hourly candle confirming (closing above $510.50)</li>
      <li>✅ No immediate resistance above until $515</li>
      <li>✅ Order flow positive (dark pool buying continues)</li>
      <li>✅ Broader market strength (QQQ, DIA also breaking out)</li>

    <p><strong>Entry price:</strong> $511.00 (limit order filled on potential breakout bar)</p>

    <h4>Position Sizing</h4>
    <p><strong>Account size:</strong> $100,000</p>
    <p><strong>Risk per trade:</strong> 1% = $1,000</p>
    <p><strong>Stop loss:</strong> $509.50 (below potential breakout level and 4-hour support)</p>
    <p><strong>Risk per share:</strong> $511.00 - $509.50 = $1.50</p>
    <p><strong>Position size:</strong> $1,000 / $1.50 = 666 shares (rounded to 650 for clean potential exit)</p>
    <p><strong>Position value:</strong> 650 × $511 = $332,150 (3.3× account size, using 3:1 margin)</p>

    <h4>Profit Targets</h4>

      <li><strong>Target 2:</strong> $518.00 (+$7.00 = 4.7R) → take 33% position (215 shares)</li>
      <li><strong>Target 3:</strong> $521.50 (+$10.50 = 7.0R) → take remaining 33% (220 shares)</li>

  <div class="trade-management">
    <h4>Day 1 (March 7): Entry</h4>
    <p><strong>10:15 AM:</strong> Enter 650 shares at $511.00</p>
    <p><strong>11:30 AM:</strong> Price tests $512, pulls back to $510.80 (normal consolidation)</p>
    <p><strong>2:00 PM:</strong> Rallies to $513 into close</p>
    <p><strong>Close:</strong> $512.85 (+$1.85 per share = +1.2R unrealized)</p>
    <p><em>Notes: Healthy price action, no stop concerns. Holding overnight with confidence.</em></p>

    <h4>Day 2 (March 8): Partial Profit</h4>
    <p><strong>9:30 AM:</strong> Gaps up to $514.20 on strong futures (Fed comments dovish)</p>
    <p><strong>10:45 AM:</strong> Hits Target 1 at $514.50—sell 215 shares, lock +$753 (+0.75R realized)</p>
    <p><strong>Action taken:</strong> Move stop to $510.80 (breakeven + spread) on remaining 435 shares</p>
    <p><strong>Close:</strong> $515.30 (remaining position +$4.30 per share = +2.9R unrealized)</p>
    <p><em>Notes: Risk eliminated. Now "free trade"—worst case is breakeven overall.</em></p>

    <h4>Day 3 (March 11): Trend Continuation</h4>
    <p><strong>Market:</strong> Gap up to $516.50, continues higher</p>
    <p><strong>Midday:</strong> Hits Target 2 at $518.00—sell 215 shares, lock +$1,505 (+1.5R realized)</p>
    <p><strong>Action taken:</strong> Trail stop on final 220 shares to $515.50 (protect +$4.50 = +3.0R)</p>
    <p><strong>Close:</strong> $519.20 (remaining position +$8.20 per share = +5.5R unrealized)</p>
    <p><em>Notes: Excellent trade. Already locked 2.25R, final position is pure alpha chase.</em></p>

    <h4>Day 4 (March 12): Volatility</h4>
    <p><strong>Open:</strong> $519.80 (inches toward Target 3)</p>
    <p><strong>11:00 AM:</strong> Spike to $521.00 (almost T3), then reversal on inflation data</p>
    <p><strong>Decision point:</strong> Price dropping quickly—hold for T3 or protect gains?</p>
    <p><strong>Action:</strong> Inflation print came in hot (0.4% vs 0.3% expected)—close remaining 220 shares at $518.50</p>
    <p><strong>Realized:</strong> +$7.50 per share on final position = +5.0R</p>
    <p><em>Reasoning: Macro headwind (hot inflation) changes thesis. Don't be greedy—lock gains.</em></p>

  <h3 id="post-trade-analysis">Post-Trade Analysis</h3>

  <div class="post-trade">
    <h4>What Went Right</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Waited 15 days for setup to mature (consolidation to tighten)</li>
      <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Didn't chase—waited for volume spike + multi-timeframe alignment</li>
      <li><strong>Position sizing:</strong> Risked exactly 1%, no more—emotionless execution</li>
      <li><strong>Scaling out:</strong> Took profits at predetermined levels, removed emotion</li>
      <li><strong>Risk management:</strong> Moved to breakeven after T1, then trailed—never gave back gains</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Closed final position early when macro changed (inflation data)—didn't marry the trade</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What Could've Been Better</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exit timing:</strong> Could've held final position for T3 at $521.50 (+7.0R vs +5.0R achieved)—cost 440R (2R × 220 shares)</li>
      <li><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Hot inflation data justified potential exit. Protecting +5R is smart, not weak</li>
      <li><strong>Scale-in option:</strong> Could've added to position on Day 2 breakout above $515 (but increases risk)</li>
      <li><strong>Options alternative:</strong> Could've used calls for leverage (e.g., $510 calls, 10-delta) for higher R-multiples</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Key Lessons</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Edge = patience + confirmation.</strong> Setup took 15 days to develop—those who waited won</li>
      <li><strong>Scaling out removes stress.</strong> Once T1 hit and stop moved to breakeven, trade became "free money"</li>
      <li><strong>Macro matters.</strong> When inflation data changed narrative, professional potential exit was correct (even if price later hit T3)</li>
      <li><strong>R-multiple thinking works.</strong> Focused on 4R+ average, achieved 3.91R—close enough to validate system</li>

  <div class="analysis-section">
    <h4>The Setup</h4>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2, 2024 (after market close earnings)</p>
    <p><strong>Event:</strong> AAPL reports Q2 earnings—misses EPS by $0.03 ($1.50 vs $1.53 expected)</p>
    <p><strong>Revenue:</strong> Beat by $1.2B ($90.8B vs $89.6B expected)—POSITIVE</p>
    <p><strong>Guidance:</strong> In-line, no surprises</p>
    <p><strong>Market reaction:</strong> Stock drops 7.8% overnight ($182 → $168)</p>

    <h4>Overreaction Thesis</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Earnings quality:</strong> Revenue beat, only minor EPS miss (likely buyback timing, not fundamental)</li>
      <li><strong>Historical context:</strong> AAPL rarely sustains 7%+ drops on minor misses—avg reversion = 50% of drop</li>

    <h4>What Went Right</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thesis-driven:</strong> Identified overreaction (EPS miss minor, revenue beat strong)</li>
      <li><strong>Confluence stacking:</strong> Technical support + order flow + sentiment extreme = high-probability setup</li>
      <li><strong>Patience after entry:</strong> Didn't panic when price dipped to $168.50 in first hour</li>
      <li><strong>Partial profits:</strong> Locked 1R at first target, gave remainder room to run</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Key Lessons</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Earnings overreactions revert.</strong> When drop is disproportionate to actual news quality, fade the panic</li>
      <li><strong>Support levels matter.</strong> Weekly 200 EMA + dark pool defense = institutional support line</li>
      <li><strong>Sentiment extremes pay.</strong> Put/call ratio 1.9 = max fear = time to buy</li>
      <li><strong>Scale out protects.</strong> First potential exit at +2R removed pressure, allowed free trade</li>

    <p><strong>Context:</strong> TSLA consolidating at $175 for 3 days after earnings beat</p>
    <p><strong>Resistance:</strong> $178 (prior week high)</p>
    <p><strong>My thesis:</strong> Breakout above $178 should trigger continuation to $185</p>
  </div>
<h3 id="the-mistake">The Mistake</h3>

  <div class="trade-execution">
    <h4>Entry (TOO EARLY)</h4>
    <p><strong>Time:</strong> 10:05 AM</p>
    <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> 5-minute candle breaks above $178.20</p>
    <p><strong>Entry price:</strong> $178.50</p>
    <p><strong>Position:</strong> 500 shares, risking 1% ($1,000) with stop at $176.50</p>

    <h4>What I Missed</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ <strong>Lower timeframe trap:</strong> 5-min potential breakout, but hourly still BELOW $178 resistance</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>No volume confirmation:</strong> Breakout volume only 1.2× average (need 2×+)</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>Order flow neutral:</strong> No dark pool buying, Pilot Line flat (no institutional support)</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>Macro headwind:</strong> SPY weak (down 0.5%), TSLA breaking out against market = suspicious</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>FOMO entry:</strong> Jumped in because I "didn't want to miss it"—emotional, not systematic</li>

    <p><strong>11:20 AM:</strong> Continues lower, stop hit at $176.50</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> -$2.00 per share × 500 shares = -$1,000 (-1.0R loss)</p>
    <p><strong>Adding insult:</strong> Price eventually does break out 2 hours later (12:30 PM) on higher volume to $182—but I'm already stopped out</p>
  </div>
<h3 id="post-mortem-what-went-wrong">Post-Mortem: What Went Wrong</h3>

  <div class="post-trade">
    <h4>Errors Committed</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Multi-timeframe failure:</strong> 5-min potential breakout is WORTHLESS without hourly/daily confirmation. 70%+ of 5-min breakouts fail</li>
      <li><strong>No volume confirmation:</strong> Breakouts need 2×+ volume to stick. 1.2× is insufficient (retail volume, not institutional)</li>
      <li><strong>Ignored order flow:</strong> Dark pools flat, Pilot Line neutral = no smart money buying the potential breakout</li>
      <li><strong>Against market trend:</strong> Never trade individual stock breakouts when broader market (SPY, QQQ) is weak</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional entry:</strong> FOMO drove potential entry, not systematic checklist. Broke my own rules</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Correct Approach (What I Should've Done)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ <strong>Wait for hourly close above $178:</strong> Confirm higher timeframe potential breakout first</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Require volume surge:</strong> Only enter if 2×+ volume accompanies potential breakout</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Check order flow:</strong> Wait for dark pool buying or Pilot Line confirmation (institutions participating)</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Market context:</strong> Only trade stock breakouts when SPY/QQQ is also strong (tailwind, not headwind)</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Follow checklist:</strong> If all boxes aren't checked, NO TRADE (better to miss than lose)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Lesson</h4>
    <p style="background-color: var(--warning-bg); padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--warning-color);">
      <strong>Multi-timeframe confluence is non-negotiable.</strong> 5-minute breakouts fail 70%+ without hourly/daily confirmation. This loss was 100% avoidable—I broke my own rules due to FOMO. The system works when followed; it fails when I don't follow it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Silver lining:</strong> Lost exactly 1R (stop respected), proving risk management works. One bad potential entry didn't blow up account.</p>

    <h4>Initial Observation</h4>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 10-18, 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> NVDA pulling back from $950 highs to $880 (7% correction)</p>
    <p><strong>Market sentiment:</strong> "AI bubble popping" narrative emerging, retail selling</p>

    <h4>Dark Pool Signals (The Edge)</h4>
    <p><strong>June 10-14:</strong> Massive institutional buying at $880-890 level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>June 10: 220K shares at $885</li>
      <li>June 11: 180K shares at $880</li>
      <li>June 12: 250K shares at $888</li>
      <li>June 13: 150K shares at $882</li>
      <li>June 14: 200K shares at $890</li>
      <li><strong>Total: 1 million+ shares accumulated at $880-890 zone</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Smart money aggressively buying the dip while retail panics—classic accumulation</p>

    <h4>Technical Confluence</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily chart:</strong> $880 is 20-day EMA support (held 8 times in past 6 months)</li>
      <li><strong>Weekly chart:</strong> Still in uptrend, pullback is healthy (not reversal)</li>
      <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Selling volume declining (June 14 only 60% of June 10 volume—sellers exhausting)</li>

    <p><strong>Entry price:</strong> $887</p>
    <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Institutions defending $880-890 zone aggressively—align with smart money</p>

    <h4>Risk Management</h4>
    <p><strong>Stop loss:</strong> $870 (below dark pool cluster and 20-day EMA)</p>

    <h4>Why It Worked</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Institutional footprints:</strong> 1M+ shares accumulated at $880-890 = undeniable smart money positioning</li>
      <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Waited for third test of support (confirmation) before entering</li>
      <li><strong>Technical confluence:</strong> Dark pools + 20-day EMA + oversold RSI = high-probability setup</li>
      <li><strong>Risk/reward:</strong> $17 risk for $58 target = 3.4:1—favorable math</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Key Lessons</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Follow the big money.</strong> When institutions accumulate 1M+ shares, they know something—align with them</li>
      <li><strong>Support clusters matter.</strong> Dark pool + EMA + psychological level = strong support</li>
      <li><strong>Patience pays.</strong> Third test of support is often the charm (first test fails 60%, third succeeds 70%)</li>

  <h4>📉 CASE STUDY: Kevin's $26,300 Copy-Paste Trading Disaster (5 weeks)</h4>
  <p><strong>Trader:</strong> Kevin, 1-year trader ($50K account), May 2024</p>
  <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Copy-paste trade alerts from premium Discord guru. Thought he found shortcut: "Just copy signals, make money, skip analysis."</p>
  <p><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> Copied SAME 18 trade alerts as guru but got opposite results due to execution context differences (entry timing, position sizing, macro awareness, psychology)</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Guru's results: 72% win rate (13W/5L), +$3,240 profit. Kevin's results copying SAME trades: 33% win rate (6W/12L), -$26,300 loss. Same signals, opposite outcomes.</p>

  <p><strong>The 7 fatal execution differences (May 2024):</strong> (1) Entry timing: Kevin entered 30sec-5min AFTER alerts posted, chased 0.2-0.5% late = missed optimal fills (guru used limit orders ready, got exact fills). Example: SPY guru @$510.20, Kevin chased @$510.68, stop hit immediately. (2) Position sizing: Kevin risked 2% per trade (4× guru's 0.5%), magnified losses. Example: TSLA guru 25 shares (0.25% risk on weak ADX day), Kevin 150 shares (2% full size) = -$2,550 vs +$75. (3) Macro ignorance: Kevin entered before FOMC (15min early), volatility whipsawed him. Guru waited until after event. AAPL: Kevin -$3,000, guru +$340 on same alert. (4) Emotional exits: Kevin panic-sold winners during pullbacks (exited at 0.8:1 R:R). Guru held with HTF confidence (2:1 R:R). NVDA: Kevin -$1,000, guru +$900. (5) Stop discipline: Guru respected stops (thesis wrong = exit). Kevin moved stops wider hoping ("give it room"), doubled losses. QQQ: Kevin -$2,950 (-2R), guru -$75 (-1R). (6) No scale-outs: Kevin held for full targets (greed), gave back winners when price reversed. Guru scaled at T1 (locked profit). COIN: Kevin -$840, guru +$520. (7) Regime blindness: Ignored guru's "half size on choppy days" notes. Traded full size in weak trends (ADX <20) = whipsaw losses -$4,200.</p>

  <p><strong>Recovery (June-July 2024):</strong> Kevin stopped copy-pasting. Spent 4 weeks studying WHY setups work: pre-trade analysis (HTF context, volume, regime), entry mechanics (limit orders vs chasing), position sizing (match risk to setup quality), exit discipline (scale-out strategy). Paper-traded 3 weeks documenting decisions. Returned to live trading July taking ONLY trades he understood completely. Results: 8 trades in 4 weeks, 62.5% win rate (5W/3L), +$4,200 profit. Same market, different approach.</p>

  <div class="callout callout-purple" style="margin-top:1rem">
    <p><strong>Kevin's lesson:</strong> "I lost $26,300 copying the SAME signals a guru profited from. Same alerts, opposite results. The difference? Context. I chased entries late, used 4× his position size, entered before FOMC events, panic-sold during normal pullbacks, moved my stops wider hoping, never scaled out, and ignored regime warnings. He got optimal fills with limit orders, sized appropriately (0.5% in weak setups), waited for volatility to pass, held through noise with HTF confidence, scaled to lock profit, respected stops when wrong, and reduced size in chop. Trade alerts are NOT plug-and-play. Entry timing, sizing, macro awareness, psychology, scaling, stop discipline, and regime matching determine results. There are no shortcuts in trading. Copy-paste trading is a shortcut to losses. Build your own process or pay the $26K education fee like I did."</p>

  <div class="key-takeaway">
    <h4>Professional Trading Principles</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Multi-timeframe confluence is non-negotiable.</strong> Lower timeframe signals (5-min) MUST be confirmed by higher timeframes (hourly, daily). 70%+ of 5-min breakouts fail without this confirmation.</li>
      <li><strong>Volume confirms validity.</strong> Breakouts need 2×+ average volume. Mean reversions work best when panic volume exhausts. No volume = no conviction.</li>
      <li><strong>Scale out removes emotion.</strong> Taking 33-50% at first target eliminates stress, lets winners run guilt-free.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk management is king.</strong> Every trade risked 1-1.5% max. One loss = -1R, didn't blow up account. This is why you survive long-term.</li>
      <li><strong>Dark pools reveal truth.</strong> 50K+ share prints show institutional positioning. When smart money accumulates, join them (don't fade them).</li>
      <li><strong>Checklists prevent mistakes.</strong> TSLA loss happened because I broke my rules (FOMO). When you follow system, you win. When you don't, you lose.</li>
      <li><strong>Macro context matters.</strong> Don't trade stock breakouts when SPY/QQQ is weak. Don't hold through adverse macro data (inflation spike). Trade WITH the wind, not against it.</li>
      <li><strong>Losses are lessons.</strong> Every failed trade teaches more than winners. Document mistakes, update checklist, don't repeat.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

<p style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:500;margin:2rem 0">Case studies bridge theory and execution. Winners teach what works; losers teach what to avoid. Multi-timeframe confluence, volume confirmation, scaling out—these aren't theoretical concepts, they're the difference between profit and loss.</p>

  <div class="practice-exercise">
    <h4>Your Action Plan: Create a Trade Journal</h4>
    <p>After each trade (win or loss), document:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Pre-trade thesis:</strong> What was your setup? Why did you expect it to work?</li>
      <li><strong>Entry checklist:</strong> Did you check all boxes (volume, multi-timeframe, order flow, macro)?</li>
      <li><strong>Position sizing:</strong> What % of account did you risk? Was stop placement logical?</li>
      <li><strong>Management:</strong> Did you scale out? Move stops? Stick to plan?</li>
      <li><strong>Exit:</strong> Hit target? Stopped out? Manual close? Why?</li>
      <li><strong>Post-mortem:</strong> What went right? What went wrong? What will you do differently?</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> After 50 trades, patterns emerge—you'll see your edge (and your leaks). This is how professionals improve.</p>
