  <h1>Career Pathways in Trading: Building a Professional Future</h1>
  <p><b>Trading isn't just solo retail. There are institutional pathways, prop firms, hedge funds, and more.</b></p>

  <h2>Path 1: Proprietary Trading Firm</h2>
  <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Firm gives you capital to trade, you split profits (70-90% yours)</p>
  <p><strong>Entry requirements:</strong> Pass evaluation (hit profit target with max drawdown limit)</p>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> FTMO, TopstepTrader, Earn2Trade (futures), The5ers (forex)</p>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Trade $50K-$200K with $150-500 evaluation cost</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Strict rules (daily loss limits, max drawdown), can lose account</p>

  <h2>Path 2: Hedge Fund / Asset Management</h2>
  <p><strong>Typical career:</strong> Analyst → Associate → Portfolio Manager</p>
  <p><strong>Entry routes:</strong> MBA + internship, or proven track record as retail trader</p>
  <p><strong>Salary:</strong> $100K-300K base + bonus (20-50% of P&L at senior levels)</p>
  <p><strong>Skill focus:</strong> Fundamental analysis, macro, research, institutional execution</p>

  <h2>Path 3: Independent Retail Trader</h2>
  <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> 95% fail within 2 years (most don't treat it as business)</p>
  <p><strong>Success requirements:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>12+ months consistent profitability (BEFORE quitting day job)</li>
    <li>6-12 months living expenses saved (for lean months)</li>
    <li>Documented system with edge (not discretionary gambling)</li>
    <li>Risk management (1% rule, daily limits, drawdown thresholds)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Income potential:</strong> 15-30% annual returns (realistic for skilled traders)</p>

  <h2>Path 4: Trading Education / Signal Service</h2>
  <p><strong>Leverage your expertise:</strong> Teach others, sell strategies, run subscription service</p>
  <p><strong>Income sources:</strong> Courses ($1K-5K/student), Discord communities ($50-200/month), 1-on-1 coaching ($200-500/hour)</p>
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Only ethical if you're ACTUALLY profitable (don't teach if you can't trade)</p>

  <h2>Path 5: Quantitative Trading / Algo Development</h2>
  <p><strong>Skills needed:</strong> Python/C++, statistics, machine learning, backtesting</p>
  <p><strong>Employers:</strong> Jane Street, Two Sigma, Citadel Securities, Jump Trading</p>
  <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> $150K-500K+ (quant firms pay TOP dollar for talent)</p>
  <p><strong>Entry:</strong> CS/Math degree from top school, or self-taught with proven algos</p>

    <h4>Choosing Your Path</h4>
    <ul>
