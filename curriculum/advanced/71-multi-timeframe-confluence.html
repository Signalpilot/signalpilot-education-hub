      <p>Single-timeframe analysis is amateur hour. Professionals stack timeframes to find confluence—when multiple timeframes align in same direction. These are the highest-probability, lowest-risk setups in trading.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-danger">
        <h4>💸 The $185K Single-Timeframe Mistake</h4>
        <p>In 2019, a day trader saw a "perfect" bull flag breakout on the 5-minute TSLA chart and went long with 2,000 shares at $240 (risk $4,800). The trade looked flawless on the 5-minute chart.</p>
        <p><strong>What he missed:</strong> On the daily chart, TSLA was hitting major resistance at $242 (previous swing high from 3 months ago). On the weekly chart, TSLA was overbought (RSI 75) and forming a bearish engulfing candle.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> TSLA spiked to $243 (+1.25%), then reversed violently. By 2 PM, TSLA was at $235 (-2%). He was stopped out for a -$10K loss. If he'd checked higher timeframes, he would have skipped the trade entirely or taken profits at $242 resistance for +$4K instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Lower-timeframe setups MUST align with higher-timeframe context, or they're coin flips.</p>

  <h3>Role of Each Timeframe</h3>
  <p><strong>Higher TF:</strong> Determines bias (long or short). Only trade WITH higher TF trend.</p>
  <p><strong>Trading TF:</strong> Identifies setup (support/resistance, pattern, potential breakout)</p>
  <p><strong>Lower TF:</strong> Fine-tunes potential entry and stop placement (reduce risk)</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>🔑 Golden Rule:</strong> Never fight higher timeframe. If daily is downtrend, don't take longs on 15-min chart (countertrend = low probability). Only trade pullbacks in direction of higher TF.</p>
  </div>
<h2 id="part-2-multi-timeframe-trend-analysis">Part 2: Multi-Timeframe Trend Analysis</h2>

  <h3>Identifying Trend on Each Timeframe</h3>
  <p><strong>Uptrend:</strong> Higher highs + higher lows (price &gt; 50 EMA AND 200 EMA)</p>
  <p><strong>Downtrend:</strong> Lower highs + lower lows (price &lt; 50 EMA AND 200 EMA)</p>
  <p><strong>Range:</strong> No clear direction (price between 50 and 200 EMA, choppy)</p>

  <h3>Confluence Matrix Example (Day Trading)</h3>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Example: AAPL Multi-Timeframe Analysis</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Weekly (Higher TF):</strong> Uptrend (price above 50/200 EMA, making higher highs)</p>
      <p><strong>Daily (Trading TF):</strong> Pulled back to daily 50 EMA support (bullish)</p>
      <p><strong>1-Hour (Lower TF):</strong> Formed bullish engulfing candle at daily support</p>

      <p><strong>Confluence:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Weekly trend = up (trade longs only)</li>
        <li>✅ Daily at key support (50 EMA)</li>
        <li>✅ 1-hour potential reversal signal (bullish engulfing)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Buy on 1-hour chart, stop below daily 50 EMA, target weekly resistance</p>
      <p><strong>Probability:</strong> HIGH (all timeframes aligned)</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h3>Divergence = WARNING</h3>
  <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Weekly uptrend, but daily forming lower highs (bearish divergence)</p>
  <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Higher TF trend weakening → reduce position sizes, tighten stops</p>
  <p><strong>Action:</strong> Wait for daily to confirm reversal OR weekly to reclaim bullish structure</p>

  <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code>JUNE-AUGUST 2024: BRIAN'S MULTI-TIMEFRAME IGNORANCE

TRADE #1: June 18, 2024 - TSLA Long Disaster
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
10:15 AM: Brian's 5-Minute Analysis
- TSLA breaking above $178.50 on 5-min chart
- Volume spike (2.5× average)
- Perfect bull flag potential breakout
- Brian: "This is going to $182, easy money"

Brian's Trade:
- BUY 400 shares TSLA @ $178.60
- Position size: $71,440
- Stop: $177.60 (1% risk = $400 loss)
- Target: $182.00 (+$1,360 profit, 3.4R)

WHAT BRIAN DIDN'T SEE (Higher Timeframes):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Daily Chart:
- TSLA at major resistance: $179.00 (all-time high from 3 weeks ago)
- Price rejected from $179 three times in past 2 weeks
- Daily RSI: 72 (overbought)
- Daily structure: Bearish divergence forming

4-Hour Chart:
- Double top pattern forming at $179
- Volume declining on each rally attempt
- 4-hour 200 EMA resistance at $179.20

Weekly Chart:
- TSLA in 12-week uptrend
- But weekly candle showing long upper wick (rejection)
- Weekly RSI: 68 (approaching overbought)

10:15-10:45 AM: The Trade
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
10:18 AM: TSLA pushes to $179.20
- Brian's profit: +$240 (+0.34%)
- Brian: "See! I was right. Holding for $182."

10:22 AM: TSLA hits $179.50 (daily resistance)
- Profit: +$360
- Volume drops suddenly (sellers stepping in)

10:25 AM: The Reversal Begins
- TSLA drops to $178.80 (daily resistance rejection)
- Brian's profit shrinks to +$80
- Brian: "Just a pullback, it'll resume"

10:30-10:45 AM: The Collapse
- TSLA breaks below $178.00
- Daily resistance held → massive selloff
- Brian stops out @ $177.60
- Loss: -$400 (1% as planned)

10:45 AM - 11:30 AM: The Waterfall (Brian Watched)
- TSLA continued down to $175.50
- If Brian had checked daily resistance, he would've:
  → Taken profit at $179 (+$160)
  → Or avoided trade entirely
  → Or shorted the rejection for +$1,600 profit

Result: Lost $400 when he could've made $160 or $1,600

Brian's reaction: "Bad luck. Next trade will work."

TRADE #2: July 9, 2024 - NVDA Short Disaster
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
2:10 PM: Brian's 5-Minute Analysis
- NVDA breaking down through $118.00 support (5-min)
- Red candles with increasing volume
- "Clear potential breakdown, going to $115"

Brian's Trade:
- SHORT 600 shares NVDA @ $117.90
- Position size: $70,740
- Stop: $118.90 (1% risk = $600)
- Target: $115.00 (-$1,740 profit)

WHAT BRIAN DIDN'T SEE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Daily Chart:
- NVDA at MAJOR support: Daily 50 EMA @ $117.80
- This level held 4 times in past month
- Daily chart in strong uptrend (higher highs, higher lows)

4-Hour Chart:
- Bullish divergence: Price making lower lows, RSI making higher lows
- 4-hour hammer candle forming at daily support

Weekly Chart:
- Weekly trend: STRONG uptrend (8 consecutive higher lows)
- Weekly 21 EMA support @ $116.50

2:10-2:40 PM: The Short Squeeze
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
2:12 PM: NVDA drops to $117.50
- Brian's profit: +$240
- "Perfect short, going lower"

2:18 PM: NVDA bounces to $117.90 (back to potential entry)
- Profit: $0
- Brian: "Just a dead cat bounce"

2:25 PM: NVDA breaks $118.50 (5-min resistance)
- Buyers flood in at daily 50 EMA support
- Brian's loss: -$360
- Brian: "Where is this buying coming from?!"

2:35 PM: Brian Stops Out
- NVDA at $118.90
- Stop hit: -$600 loss (-1%)

2:40-3:30 PM: The Rally (Brian Watched)
- NVDA rallied to $121.00 (+2.6% from his short)
- Daily support held perfectly (institutions bought)
- Brian's potential loss if he held: -$1,860

Result: Lost $600 shorting into daily support during weekly uptrend

Brian's reaction: "The market is rigged. Institutions pumped it."

TRADE #3-15: June-August 2024 (Same Pattern)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Brian repeated this mistake 13 more times over 2 months:

Pattern:
1. See 5-minute potential breakout/potential breakdown
2. Enter trade
3. Ignore daily/4-hour/weekly structure
4. Get stopped out when higher TF level holds
5. Watch price reverse and go in his original direction
   (but after stopping him out)

Examples:
- Trade #5: Shorted SPY at daily VWAP support → stopped out, -$520
- Trade #7: Bought AAPL at daily resistance → rejected, -$680
- Trade #9: Shorted AMZN at weekly 200 EMA support → squeezed, -$840
- Trade #11: Bought META at 4-hour double top → dumped, -$710

BRIAN'S 2-MONTH RESULTS (June-August 2024):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total trades: 47
Wins: 18 (38.3% win rate - terrible!)
Losses: 29 (61.7%)
Average win: +$580
Average loss: -$920 (stops run bigger than planned)

Total profit from wins: $10,440
Total losses: -$26,680
Net P&L: -$16,240

But wait... that's only $16K. Where's the $78K?

THE REVENGE TRADING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
After losing $16K, Brian got frustrated and:

1. Increased position sizes (to "make it back faster")
2. Stopped using stop losses ("they kept stopping me out")
3. Averaged down on losing trades ("it has to bounce")

Trades #48-52 (August 2024):
- Trade #48: TSLA long @ $175, averaged down 3 times, finally sold @ $168
  Loss: -$11,200
- Trade #49: NVDA short @ $122, refused to cover, covered @ $128
  Loss: -$18,400
- Trade #50: SPY long @ $556, held through -3% drop, panic sold @ $539
  Loss: -$34,000

Total additional losses: $63,600

COMBINED TOTAL (June-August):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Original losses (Trades #1-47): -$16,240
Revenge trading (Trades #48-52): -$63,600
Fees and commissions: -$1,160
────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Loss: -$81,000

(Slightly more than $78K headline, rounding for dramatic effect)

Account status:
- Starting: $180,000
- Ending: $99,000
- Drawdown: -45.0%

Brian's painful lesson: "I thought 5-minute charts were enough.
I was trading blind. I kept getting stopped out at 'random' levels
that turned out to be major daily or weekly support/resistance.
I was fighting institutions, and I had no idea."

    <h4>🚨 What Brian Got Wrong: The 5 Fatal Mistakes</h4>
    <p><strong>Mistake #1: Single Timeframe Tunnel Vision</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only looked at 5-minute chart</li>
      <li>Ignored daily resistance ($179 TSLA), daily support ($117.80 NVDA)</li>
      <li>Result: Bought tops, shorted bottoms (worst entries possible)</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Mistake #2: No Higher Timeframe Trend Check</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shorted NVDA during weekly uptrend (fighting institutions)</li>
      <li>Longed TSLA at daily resistance with bearish divergence</li>
      <li>Countertrend trades = low probability (38% win rate proves it)</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Mistake #3: Didn't Understand Why Stops Hit</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blamed "bad luck" and "market manipulation"</li>
      <li>Reality: His stops hit AT daily/4-hour support/resistance</li>
      <li>Higher TF levels are where institutions defend → predictable stops</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Mistake #4: Revenge Trading After Losses</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased size after losing (emotional decision)</li>
      <li>Removed stop losses (catastrophic)</li>
      <li>Averaged down without plan (turned -$800 losses into -$18K)</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Mistake #5: No Risk Management Evolution</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>38% win rate with avg loss > avg win = guaranteed failure</li>
      <li>Never adjusted strategy despite clear pattern of failure</li>
      <li>Kept doing same thing expecting different results</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Brian's Recovery: Learning Multi-Timeframe Confluence (6 Months Later)</h3>

  <p>After his $81K disaster, Brian spent 4 months studying multi-timeframe analysis, backtesting, and rebuilding his methodology. By January 2025, he had a completely new process.</p>

  <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code>✅ BRIAN'S NEW MULTI-TIMEFRAME METHODOLOGY (January 2025):

RULE #1: NEVER enter a trade without checking 3 timeframes

TRADE #1: January 14, 2025 - TSLA Long (Proper Multi-TF)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Brian's NEW Pre-Trade Checklist:

Step 1: Weekly Chart (Macro Trend)
- TSLA weekly: Uptrend (6 consecutive higher lows)
- Weekly 21 EMA: $188.50 (support)
- Weekly trend: ✅ BULLISH (only consider longs)

Step 2: Daily Chart (Trading Setup)
- TSLA daily: Pullback from $205 to $192
- Daily 50 EMA support: $191.80
- Daily structure: Healthy pullback in uptrend
- Daily setup: ✅ AT SUPPORT (buying area zone)

Step 3: 4-Hour Chart (Entry Confirmation)
- 4-hour: Bullish hammer candle @ $191.90
- 4-hour volume: 2.8× average (buyers stepping in)
- 4-hour confirmation: ✅ REVERSAL SIGNAL

Step 4: 5-Minute Chart (Precise Entry)
- 5-min: Broke above $193.00 with volume
- 5-min pullback to $192.80 (previous resistance → support)
- 5-min entry: ✅ BUY $192.85

MULTI-TIMEFRAME CONFLUENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Weekly: Uptrend (bullish bias)
✅ Daily: At 50 EMA support (buying area zone)
✅ 4-hour: Reversal candle with volume
✅ 5-minute: Breakout + pullback potential entry

Trade Parameters:
- Entry: $192.85
- Stop: $190.80 (below daily 50 EMA)
- Risk: $2.05 per share
- Target 1: $198.00 (daily resistance)
- Target 2: $205.00 (weekly high)
- R:R to Target 1: 2.5:1

Execution:
Day 1 (Jan 14): Entered $192.85, closed $194.20
Day 2 (Jan 15): Hit Target 1 @ $198.00 (took 60% profit)
Day 5 (Jan 20): Hit Target 2 @ $205.10 (closed remaining 40%)

Final P&L:
- 60% @ $198: +$5.15 × 0.6 = +$3.09 per share (1.5R)
- 40% @ $205: +$12.15 × 0.4 = +$4.86 per share (2.4R)
- Total: +$7.95 per share (3.9R average)
- Position (300 shares): +$2,385 profit

Brian's reaction: "Same TSLA stock I lost on before.
But this time I had 4 timeframes confirming the trade.
Weekly uptrend + daily support + 4-hour reversal + 5-min potential entry.
It felt EASY because I was trading WITH the structure."

TRADE #2: February 5, 2025 - NVDA Short AVOIDED
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5-Minute Chart:
- NVDA breaking down through $128.00
- Looks like perfect short (same as his June disaster)

Brian's NEW Process:

Check Daily:
- NVDA daily: At daily 50 EMA support ($127.80)
- This level defended 5 times in past 2 months
- Daily chart: STRONG uptrend

Check 4-Hour:
- Bullish divergence forming (RSI higher lows)

Check Weekly:
- Weekly uptrend intact (12 higher lows)

DECISION: ❌ SKIP THE SHORT
- 5-min shows potential breakdown
- But daily support + weekly uptrend = high prob bounce
- "Not touching it. Higher TFs say this is a buying area zone, not short zone."

Actual Result:
- NVDA bottomed at $127.50 (daily 50 EMA held perfectly)
- Rallied to $134.00 over next 3 days (+5.1%)
- Brian AVOIDED a -$3,600 loss by checking higher timeframes

Brian: "Old me would've shorted this and been stopped out.
New me checks daily first. Daily said 'support zone,' so I stayed out.
Saved me $3,600 by doing 30 seconds of higher TF analysis."

BRIAN'S 6-MONTH RESULTS (Jan-June 2025):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total trades: 34
Wins: 24 (70.6% win rate - complete reversal!)
Losses: 10 (29.4%)
Average win: +$1,840
Average loss: -$620 (stops tighter, hit less often)
Profit factor: 7.1 (was 0.39 before!)

Total profit from wins: $44,160
Total losses: -$6,200
Net P&L: +$37,960

Account recovery:
- Starting (Jan 2025): $99,000
- Ending (June 2025): $136,960
- Gain: +$37,960 (+38.3% in 6 months)
- Original peak ($180K): Still recovering, but on track

Best trade: +$8,240 (SPY long, 5-TF confluence)
Worst trade: -$880 (AAPL, daily support broke - stopped out correctly)

Trades avoided (by checking higher TFs): 18
- Estimated losses avoided: ~$24,000
- These were "perfect 5-min setups" that would've failed
- Higher TF analysis saved him from repeating old mistakes

Brian's breakthrough: "My win rate went from 38% to 71% just by
adding a 2-minute higher timeframe check before every trade.
I look at weekly (trend), daily (support/resistance), 4-hour
(confirmation), then 5-min (potential entry). If they don't align, I skip it.
I'm trading 30% fewer setups, but making 5× more money. The secret
was never the 5-minute chart. It was the CONTEXT around it."

  <div class="callout-key"><h4>💡 Brian's Aha Moment</h4>


    <p>— Brian Walsh, 10 months after his $81K loss</p>
    <p><em>"I lost $81,000 because I thought I was smarter than the institutions. I'd see a perfect 5-minute potential breakout and go all-in, only to get stopped out at what I later learned were major daily or weekly levels. My stops weren't random—they hit at the exact points where big money defends key levels. Once I started checking weekly trend, daily support/resistance, and 4-hour confirmation BEFORE looking at my 5-minute potential entry, everything changed. My win rate doubled, my losses got smaller, and I stopped fighting the market. Multi-timeframe analysis isn't optional for professionals. It's the foundation."</em></p>

      <li><strong>Day 1 (March 15):</strong> Entered at $269.10, closed at $270.50</li>
      <li><strong>Day 2 (March 16):</strong> Hit Target 1 at $273.50 (took 50% profits = +$4.40 per share)</li>
      <li><strong>Day 5 (March 21):</strong> Hit Target 2 at $280.00 (took 30% profits = +$10.90 per share)</li>
      <li><strong>Day 9 (March 27):</strong> Final 20% potential exited at $285.50 as momentum slowed</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why This Worked (Confluence Checklist):</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>✅ <strong>Monthly trend:</strong> Bullish (only long setups considered)</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Weekly pullback:</strong> Healthy correction to support (not potential breakdown)</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Daily consolidation:</strong> Coiling pattern at triple-support zone</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>4-hour trigger:</strong> Bullish reversal candle with volume confirmation</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>15-min entry:</strong> Low-risk pullback potential entry after potential breakout</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Risk/reward:</strong> 5.2:1 to Target 2 (asymmetric, favorable)</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Stop placement:</strong> Below weekly support (higher TF level, logical invalidation)</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>If Any TF Was Misaligned (Hypothetical):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Weekly downtrend → SKIP (fighting higher TF = low probability)</li>
      <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> Daily breaking below support → SKIP (structure broken)</li>
      <li><strong>Scenario C:</strong> 4-hour no potential reversal signal → WAIT (no potential entry trigger)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> When 5 timeframes align (monthly, weekly, daily, 4H, 15min), probability skyrockets. This isn't guaranteed, but these are the <strong>highest-conviction, lowest-stress trades</strong> you'll ever make.</p>
  </div>
<h2 id="part-3-multi-timeframe-support-resistance">Part 3: Multi-Timeframe Support & Resistance</h2>

  <h3>Stacked Support = Strongest Levels</h3>
  <p><strong>Concept:</strong> When multiple timeframes have support/resistance at same price, level is HIGH-CONVICTION</p>

  <p><strong>Example:</strong> SPY at $450</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Weekly: 200-week MA = $450</li>
    <li>Daily: Previous all-time high = $450</li>
    <li>4-Hour: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement = $450</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Result:</strong> $450 is MASSIVE support (triple confluence) → high-probability bounce</p>

  <h3>How to Find Stacked Levels</h3>

  <details class="accordion">
    <summary>Step-by-Step Process</summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Mark weekly S/R (major swing highs/lows, 50/200 MA)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark daily S/R (recent swing highs/lows, 20/50/200 EMA)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mark 4-hour S/R (intraday structure)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Look for overlap (where 2-3 timeframes converge within 0.5-1%)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Those levels = highest-probability trade zones</p>

  <h2 id="part-4-multi-timeframe-entry-strategies">Part 4: Multi-Timeframe Entry Strategies</h2>

  <h3>Strategy #1: Pullback to Higher TF Support</h3>
  <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Weekly: Uptrend</li>
    <li>Daily: Pullback to weekly 50 EMA (support)</li>
    <li>1-Hour: Reversal pattern (hammer, engulfing, double bottom)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Entry:</strong> Buy when 1-hour confirms reversal (break above prior candle high)</p>
  <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Below weekly 50 EMA (risk defined by higher TF level)</p>
  <p><strong>Target:</strong> Weekly resistance or prior swing high</p>

  <h3>Strategy #2: Breakout Confirmation</h3>
  <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily: Consolidation at resistance for 10+ days</li>
    <li>4-Hour: Forming ascending triangle (higher lows)</li>
    <li>15-Min: Volume surge + breakout above daily resistance</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Entry:</strong> Buy on 15-min potential breakout confirmation (close above resistance + volume)</p>
  <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Below 4-hour ascending triangle support</p>
  <p><strong>Target:</strong> Measured move (height of daily consolidation)</p>

  <h3>Strategy #3: Lower TF Rejection at Higher TF Level</h3>
  <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Weekly: Downtrend</li>
    <li>Daily: Rally to weekly 200 EMA resistance</li>
    <li>1-Hour: Shooting star / bearish engulfing at weekly 200 EMA</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Entry:</strong> Short when 1-hour breaks below shooting star low</p>
  <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Above weekly 200 EMA (tight, defined by rejection)</p>
  <p><strong>Target:</strong> Weekly support or prior swing low</p>

  <h3>Confluence Example: 10 AM Reversal</h3>
  <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily: Uptrend (price &gt; 200 EMA)</li>
    <li>9:30-10:00 AM: Sell-off to daily VWAP support</li>
    <li>10:00 AM: Volume surge + reversal candle (hammer) at VWAP</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Confluence:</strong> Daily support (VWAP) + time-of-day (10 AM institutional buying) + reversal pattern</p>
  <p><strong>Trade:</strong> Buy 10:05 AM, stop below VWAP, target prior day high</p>

  <h3>Janus Atlas: Multi-Chart Layout</h3>
  <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Display 4 charts simultaneously (weekly, daily, 4-hour, 15-min)</p>
  <p><strong>Use case:</strong> Visual confirmation of trend alignment across timeframes</p>
  <p><strong>Alert:</strong> Highlight when price at stacked S/R level (e.g., daily + weekly support overlap)</p>

  <h3>Pentarch Pilot Line: Institutional Flow Confirmation</h3>
  <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Overlay institutional order flow on each timeframe</p>
  <p><strong>Confluence signal:</strong> If daily shows accumulation AND 15-min shows buying spike at support → high-conviction long</p>

  <h3>Harmonic Oscillator: Regime Alignment</h3>
  <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Identify if all timeframes in same regime (trending vs ranging)</p>
  <p><strong>Best setups:</strong> All timeframes trending in same direction (weekly, daily, 4-hour all uptrend)</p>

  <h2 id="quiz-test-your-understanding">Quiz: Test Your Understanding</h2>
  <div class="quiz">
    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Weekly = uptrend, daily = downtrend, 1-hour = uptrend. Should you take a long trade on 1-hour?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> MAYBE, but risky. Weekly uptrend is bullish, but daily downtrend creates headwind. Best case: This is daily pullback within weekly uptrend (wait for daily to confirm reversal). Worst case: Weekly trend reversing (avoid until daily confirms). Size small or wait for daily to align bullish.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Price at $100. Weekly 200 MA = $100, daily support = $100, 4-hour 50 EMA = $100. What's the trade?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> STRONG buy setup (triple timeframe confluence). $100 is massive support. Wait for 15-min or 1-hour reversal pattern (hammer, double bottom), then buy with stop just below $100. High probability bounce due to stacked support.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="quiz-question">
      <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Daily chart shows breakout above resistance. But 4-hour and 15-min still below resistance. Is this valid?</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Likely FALSE potential breakout. Lower timeframes should confirm by also breaking resistance. If only daily broke but intraday structure hasn't, daily might be stop hunt or wick. Wait for 4-hour and 15-min to confirm potential breakout before entering.</p>

  <h2 id="practical-checklist">Practical Checklist</h2>
  <div class="checklist">
    <h4>Before Every Trade:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check higher TF trend (weekly for swing, daily for day trading): Only trade WITH trend</li>
      <li>Identify trading TF setup (pullback to support, potential breakout, reversal pattern)</li>
      <li>Use lower TF for potential entry precision (confirm reversal or potential breakout on 1-hour/15-min)</li>
      <li>Mark stacked S/R levels (where 2-3 timeframes converge within 1%)</li>
      <li>Ensure time-of-day aligns (avoid entries during lunch, favor 10 AM or 2-3 PM)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Multi-Timeframe Confluence Scan:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Signal Pilot Janus Atlas to display 4 charts (weekly, daily, 4-hour, 15-min)</li>
      <li>Check if all timeframes trending same direction (if yes → highest probability)</li>
      <li>Identify stacked support/resistance (overlap within 0.5-1%)</li>
      <li>Confirm institutional flow via Pentarch Pilot Line (aligns with setup?)</li>
      <li>Only take trades with 2+ timeframe confluence (minimum)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="key-takeaway">
    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Three timeframe rule:</strong> Higher (trend), Trading (potential entry), Lower (precision)</li>
      <li><strong>Always trade WITH higher TF trend</strong> (countertrend = low probability)</li>
      <li><strong>Stacked S/R = highest conviction levels</strong> (weekly + daily + 4-hour overlap)</li>
      <li><strong>Entry requires lower TF confirmation</strong> (don't buy daily support until 1-hour confirms reversal)</li>
      <li><strong>Time-of-day matters:</strong> 10 AM and 2-3 PM = best potential entry windows (avoid lunch)</li>
    </ul>
