      <h2>Short-Term vs. Long-Term Capital Gains</h2>
      
      <h3>Tax Rates (US)</h3>
      <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tr><th>Hold Period</th><th>Tax Rate</th><th>$100K Gain → Tax</th></tr>
        <tr><td>< 1 year (short-term)</td><td>Ordinary income (22-37%)</td><td>$22K-37K</td></tr>
        <tr><td>> 1 year (long-term)</td><td>Capital gains (0-20%)</td><td>$0-20K</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p><b>Holding 366 days vs. 364 days = $17K tax savings on $100K gain!</b></p>

      <h3>Trader vs. Investor Tax Status</h3>
      <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Investor</th><th>Trader (TTS)</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Trading frequency</td><td>Occasional</td><td>Daily, substantial</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hold period</td><td>Months-years</td><td>Days-weeks</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Intent</td><td>Long-term growth</td><td>Short-term profits</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Deductions</td><td>Limited (investment fees)</td><td>Business expenses (home office, software, data)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Mark-to-Market</td><td>No</td><td>Optional (MTM election)</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Trader Tax Status (TTS)</h2>
      
      <h3>Qualifying for TTS</h3>
      <p><strong>IRS criteria (all must be met):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Substantial activity:</b> Trade frequently (750+ trades/year guideline)</li>
        <li><b>Regularity:</b> Trade most days market open</li>
        <li><b>Continuity:</b> Trading is primary income source</li>
        <li><b>Intent:</b> Profit from short-term price movements (not dividends/interest)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>TTS Benefits</h3>
      <pre><code>Business Expense Deductions:
- Home office (dedicated trading space)
- Trading platform fees ($200/month × 12 = $2,400)
- Market data (Bloomberg, Reuters = $2,000/month)
- Computer equipment ($5,000)
- Education (courses, books)
- Professional fees (CPA, attorney)

Total deductions: $25K-50K/year (reduces taxable income!)</code></pre>

      <h2>Mark-to-Market (MTM) Election</h2>
      
      <h3>What is MTM?</h3>
      <p><strong>Treat all positions as closed on Dec 31 (paper gains/losses count).</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Without MTM:
- Only realized gains taxed
- Unrealized losses don't help (can't deduct)

With MTM:
- All positions marked to market (treated as sold Dec 31)
- Unrealized gains = taxable
- Unrealized losses = deductible

Benefit: Eliminates wash sale rule (see below)</code></pre>

      <h3>When to Elect MTM</h3>
      <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>MTM?</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Day trader (close all positions daily)</td><td>Yes (avoids wash sales)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Swing trader (hold 1-7 days)</td><td>Maybe (consult CPA)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Position trader (hold weeks-months)</td><td>No (lose long-term capital gains)</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Wash Sale Rule</h2>
      
      <h3>The Rule</h3>
      <p><strong>Can't deduct loss if you rebuy "substantially identical" security within 30 days.</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Example (Wash Sale):
Jan 1: Buy 100 SPY at $500 = $50,000
Jan 15: Sell 100 SPY at $480 = $48,000 (loss: -$2,000)
Jan 20: Buy 100 SPY at $485

Result: -$2,000 loss DISALLOWED (bought back within 30 days)
Instead: Loss added to cost basis of new position</code></pre>

      <h3>Avoiding Wash Sales</h3>
      <pre><code>Option 1: Wait 31 days before rebuying
Jan 15: Sell SPY (loss)
Feb 16: Can rebuy SPY (31+ days, loss deductible)

Option 2: Buy similar but not identical security
Sell SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
Buy IVV or VOO (also S&P 500 ETFs, NOT identical per IRS)

Option 3: MTM election (eliminates wash sale rule)</code></pre>

      <h2>Tax-Loss Harvesting</h2>
      
      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <p><strong>Realize losses to offset gains (reduce taxable income).</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Your year-end positions:
- SPY: +$50,000 gain (sell, lock gain)
- QQQ: -$15,000 unrealized loss (sell, realize loss)
- IWM: +$5,000 gain (sell)

Net taxable gain: $50K + $5K - $15K = $40K

Tax saved: $15K loss × 37% rate = $5,550

Action: After 31 days, rebuy QQQ (maintain exposure, saved taxes)</code></pre>

      <h3>Annual Strategy</h3>
      <pre><code>December Tax-Loss Harvesting Checklist:
1. Review all open positions
2. Identify unrealized losses
3. If loss > 30 days old → Sell (harvest loss)
4. Wait 31 days, rebuy (or buy similar ETF)
5. Use losses to offset gains

Result: Lower tax bill, maintain market exposure</code></pre>

      <h2>Entity Structuring</h2>
      
      <h3>Trading Entities</h3>
      <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tr><th>Entity</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Individual (Schedule D)</td><td>Simple, no setup cost</td><td>High tax rates, limited deductions</td></tr>
        <tr><td>LLC (pass-through)</td><td>Business deductions, liability protection</td><td>Self-employment tax (15.3%)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>S-Corp</td><td>Lower self-employment tax (salary only)</td><td>Payroll complexity, more admin</td></tr>
        <tr><td>C-Corp</td><td>21% flat tax rate</td><td>Double taxation (corp + dividend)</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>LLC vs. S-Corp for Traders</h3>
      <pre><code>Scenario: $200K trading profit

Individual:
Income tax: $200K × 32% = $64,000

LLC (pass-through):
Income tax: $200K × 32% = $64,000
SE tax: $200K × 15.3% = $30,600
Total: $94,600 (ouch!)

S-Corp:
Salary: $80K (SE tax: $80K × 15.3% = $12,240)
Distribution: $120K (NO SE tax!)
Income tax: $200K × 32% = $64,000
Total: $76,240

Savings: $94,600 - $76,240 = $18,360/year!</code></pre>

      <h2>Retirement Accounts for Traders</h2>
      
      <h3>Tax-Advantaged Trading</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>IRA (Traditional):</b> Tax-deferred growth, deduct contributions</li>
        <li><b>Roth IRA:</b> Tax-free growth (no tax on gains!)</li>
        <li><b>Solo 401(k):</b> $69K contribution limit (2024), self-employed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Roth IRA Strategy</h3>
      <pre><code>Max contribution: $7,000/year (2024)

Year 1: Contribute $7,000
Trade aggressively (short-term gains = normally 37% tax)
Year 10: Grow to $70,000

Withdraw (age 59.5+): $70,000 tax-free!

Benefit: NO capital gains tax (vs. 37% short-term in taxable account)</code></pre>
