# Stop Losses Don't Protect You (If Placed Wrong)

## The Hook

"I'll just put a 2% stop."

Price dumps 2.1%, stop hits. Then immediate reversal. Your thesis was right. Your stop was wrong.

This happens because **the market doesn't care about your account size**. Your 2% might be 0.3% from entry (way too tight) or 15% from entry (way too wide).

**Stop placement should reflect MARKET volatility, not account percentage.**

This article covers:
- Why percentage stops fail
- ATR-based stop methodology
- Structure-based stops
- The 2R rule for targets

## Part 1: The Percentage Stop Myth

### Why "2% Risk" Fails

**Example:**

```
Scenario A: Low Volatility Stock
Account: $10,000
Risk: 2% = $200
Entry: $100

2% stop → $98 stop

ATR: $0.50 (0.5% daily range)
Proper stop: $100 - (2 × $0.50) = $99

Your stop at $98: 2× ATR (appropriate)
✓ Gives trade room to breathe
```

```
Scenario B: High Volatility Crypto
Account: $10,000
Risk: 2% = $200
Entry: $45,000

2% stop → $44,100 stop
Stop distance: $900

ATR: $1,200 (2.7% daily range)
Proper stop: $45,000 - (2 × $1,200) = $42,600

Your stop at $44,100: 0.75× ATR
✗ WAY too tight
✓ Gets hit by normal noise
```

**Insight:** Same 2% account risk = appropriate in A, terrible in B.

## Part 2: ATR-Based Stops

### The Method

**ATR (Average True Range):** Measures volatility

```
Stop Distance = Multiplier × ATR

Common Multipliers:
Conservative: 2.5-3.0× ATR
Standard: 2.0× ATR
Aggressive: 1.5× ATR

Example:
Price: $45,000
ATR(14): $800

Stop: $45,000 - (2 × $800) = $43,400
Stop Distance: $1,600 (3.56% from entry)
```

### Why ATR Works

**Adapts to market conditions:**

```
Low Volatility Period:
ATR: $400
Stop: $45,000 - $800 = $44,200
(Tight, appropriate for calm market)

High Volatility Period:
ATR: $1,500
Stop: $45,000 - $3,000 = $42,000
(Wide, appropriate for wild market)

Same method, adapts automatically.
```

## Part 3: Structure-Based Stops

### The Concept

**Place stops beyond KEY LEVELS:**

- Below support (longs)
- Above resistance (shorts)
- Beyond swing points
- Outside range boundaries

### Examples

**Support-Based Stop (Long):**

```
Entry: $45,200
Support Level: $44,500
Stop: $44,300 (below support + buffer)

Why: If support breaks, thesis invalid
```

**Swing Low Stop (Long):**

```
Recent Swing Low: $43,800
Stop: $43,600 (below swing + buffer)

Why: If swing broken, structure invalidated
```

**Range Stop (Range Trade):**

```
Range: $44,500 - $45,500
Entry (short): $45,400
Stop: $45,700 (above range + buffer)

Why: If range breaks, no longer range trade
```

### Structure + ATR Combined

**Best Practice:**

```
Method 1: Structure Stop
Stop below support: $44,300

Method 2: ATR Stop
2× ATR stop: $43,400

Use WIDER stop (more conservative):
Final Stop: $43,400

Why: Gives thesis maximum chance
```

## Part 4: The 2R Rule

### What Is 2R?

**R = Risk per trade**

```
Entry: $45,000
Stop: $43,000
Risk (1R): $2,000

Target (2R): Entry + (2 × Risk)
           = $45,000 + $4,000
           = $49,000
```

**Minimum target should be 2× your risk.**

### Why 2R Matters

**Breakeven Math:**

```
Win Rate Needed to Breakeven:

1:1 R:R → Need 50% win rate
1:2 R:R → Need 33% win rate
1:3 R:R → Need 25% win rate

With 2R minimum:
Even 40% win rate = profitable
```

**Example:**

```
10 Trades, 1R = $100 risk each

Win Rate: 40% (4 wins, 6 losses)

Losses: 6 × -$100 = -$600
Wins: 4 × +$200 = +$800

Net: +$200 profit

Same win rate with 1R targets:
Wins: 4 × +$100 = +$400
Net: -$200 loss

2R target turns losing system into winner.
```

## Part 5: When NOT to Use Stops

### Scenario 1: Hedged Positions

```
Portfolio:
Long BTC spot: $10K
Short BTC futures: $10K (hedge)

Stop not needed (positions offset)
```

### Scenario 2: Options (Defined Risk)

```
Buy Call Option: $500 max loss

Stop not needed (loss capped at premium)
```

### Scenario 3: Very Wide Stops + Small Size

```
Swing trade:
Entry: $45,000
Logical stop: $38,000 (major support)

Position size: 0.05 BTC (small)
Max loss: $350 (acceptable)

Mental stop, no hard stop
(Avoids stop hunt, accepts wide invalidation)
```

## Part 6: Stop Management

### Never Move Stops Looser

**Rule: Stops can only move TIGHTER (in your favor), never wider.**

```
✓ ALLOWED:
Entry: $45,000, Stop: $43,000
Price reaches $48,000
Move stop to $46,000 (breakeven)

✗ FORBIDDEN:
Entry: $45,000, Stop: $43,000
Price drops to $43,500 (near stop)
Move stop to $42,000 ("give it more room")

Why forbidden: Invalidates entire risk plan
```

### Trailing Stops

**Method 1: ATR Trail**

```
Entry: $45,000
Initial Stop: $43,000 (2× ATR below)

Price hits $48,000:
New Stop: $48,000 - (2 × ATR)
        = $48,000 - $1,600
        = $46,400

Lock in profit, let winner run.
```

**Method 2: Structural Trail**

```
Entry: $45,000
Price making higher lows: $46K, $47K, $48K

Trail stop below each higher low:
Stop at $47,500 (below $48K higher low)
```

2. **Structure-based** - Respects key levels
3. **Use wider** of ATR or structure
4. **2R minimum** target
5. **Never widen** stops
6. **Trail** as profit grows

Get stops right → Preserve capital → Stay in the game.
