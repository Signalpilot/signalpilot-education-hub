## The Hook: The Perfect Backtest Trap

You found the "holy grail" indicator. Backtested it. 87% win rate. Sharpe ratio of 3.2. Equity curve looks like a staircase to heaven.

You go live. First week: 2 wins, 5 losses. Second week: 1 win, 4 losses. The indicator that "never failed" in backtest is failing spectacularly in live trading.

**What happened?**

Your indicator was **repainting**. It was showing you signals in hindsight that never existed in real-time. The backtest was a lie. The signals were retroactively perfect because they were calculated with future information you wouldn't have had at the time.

**60-90% of retail indicators repaint.** If you're not actively checking, you're probably trading with repainted data.

This article will teach you:
- What repainting is and why it's so common
- How to detect it in any indicator
- Why Signal Pilot indicators don't repaint (the deterministic protocol)
- How to audit indicators yourself

By the end, you'll never trust an indicator blindly again.

## Part 1: What Is Repainting?

### The Definition

**Repainting:** When an indicator's historical values change after the fact, making past signals appear better than they were in real-time.

### Why It Happens

**1. Real-Time Calculation vs. Historical Calculation**

```pine
// REPAINTING CODE EXAMPLE (TradingView Pine Script)

// This code REPAINTS because it uses 'security()' with lookahead
htf_close = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", close)

// On live candle: Uses current daily close (changes every minute)
// After candle closes: Uses fixed historical daily close
// Result: Signal looks different in backtest than real-time
```

**2. Using Future Candles in Calculation**

```pine
// REPAINTING: Uses next candle's data

indicator("Repainting Example", overlay=true)
future_high = high[1]  // Looks at NEXT candle (offset = -1)
plot(future_high)

// In backtest: Always knows the next candle
// In live: Can't know next candle until it forms
// Result: Perfect signals in backtest, useless live
```

**3. Changing Calculation Based on Current Candle**

```pine
// REPAINTING: Changes past values when new candle forms

var float stored_value = na
if close > close[1]
    stored_value := high  // Changes every candle
plot(stored_value)

// Result: Past values of "stored_value" change retroactively
```

### The Visual Proof

**Repainting Indicator Behavior:**

```
LIVE CHART (Right now, real-time):
Candle 1: BUY signal appears
Candle 2: BUY signal disappears, SELL signal appears
Candle 3: SELL signal moves to Candle 2
Candle 4: All signals rearrange

You: "Wait, where did my entry signal go?!"

HISTORICAL CHART (Same period, after the fact):
Candle 1: SELL signal (not BUY!)
Candle 2: No signal
Candle 3: BUY signal appears
Candle 4: Signal stays fixed

BACKTEST: Uses historical chart (perfect signals)
LIVE TRADING: Uses real-time chart (moving targets)

Result: Backtest win rate 85%, live win rate 45%
```

---

## Part 2: The Types of Repainting

### Type 1: Higher Timeframe (HTF) Repainting

**Most common form.**

```pine
// REPAINTING VERSION
daily_close = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", close)
// Problem: On 15m chart, "daily close" changes every 15 minutes
//          until daily candle actually closes

// Example:
// 9:00 AM: daily_close = $45,200 (current daily candle)
// 9:15 AM: daily_close = $45,350 (daily candle moved)
// 9:30 AM: daily_close = $45,100 (daily candle moved again)
// ...
// 11:59 PM: daily_close = $45,500 (FINAL, doesn't change anymore)

// In backtest: Always uses the final value ($45,500)
// In live: Uses changing value ($45,200 → $45,350 → $45,100...)
```

**NON-REPAINTING VERSION:**

```pine
// Use 'lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on' with offset
daily_close = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", close[1],
                                lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
// Now uses PREVIOUS COMPLETED daily candle
// Doesn't change during current day
```

### Type 2: Indicator Repainting (Future Data)

**Using data that doesn't exist yet.**

```pine
// REPAINTING: Pivot High calculation

pivotHigh = ta.pivothigh(high, 5, 5)
// Requires 5 candles on LEFT and RIGHT
// Problem: Can't know if current candle is a pivot until 5 candles LATER
// In backtest: Knows which candles were pivots (already happened)
// In live: Can't know until 5 candles pass (signal is 5 candles late)

// Visual:
// Backtest shows: Pivot signal at the actual high
// Live trading: Signal appears 5 candles AFTER the high
// You're trading old information
```

### Type 3: Alert Repainting

**Alerts that trigger but then disappear.**

```pine
// REPAINTING ALERT

alertcondition(close > ema, "Buy Signal")
// Problem: If close TOUCHES ema during candle, alert fires
//          But if candle closes BELOW ema, condition is false
//          Alert fired, but signal isn't actually there in history

// Result:
// Live: You get alert, enter trade
// Backtest: No signal exists at that candle (didn't close above EMA)
// Journal: "My backtest doesn't match my trades!"
```

### Type 4: Strategy Repainting

**Strategies that look perfect but can't be executed.**

```pine
// REPAINTING STRATEGY

strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, when = close > high[1])
// Problem: Uses BAR MAGNIFIER (intrabar data)
// In backtest: Sees every tick, "perfect" entries
// In live: Only sees close, entries don't match

// Backtest: Enters at perfect intrabar high
// Live: Enters at candle close (could be much worse price)
```

## Part 3: Why Repainting Is So Prevalent

### The Indicator Marketplace Incentive Problem

**Vendor Perspective:**

```
Goal: Sell indicators
Method: Show amazing backtests

Repainting Indicator:
- Backtest: 85% win rate, $100K profit on $10K
- Sales: "Proven system! Look at the equity curve!"
- Cost: $99/month
- Marketing: Screenshots of perfect signals

Non-Repainting Indicator:
- Backtest: 58% win rate, $25K profit on $10K
- Sales: "Realistic edge, solid expectancy"
- Cost: $99/month
- Marketing: Honest statistics

Which sells more? The lie.
```

**Why Buyers Don't Detect It:**

1. Most don't know what repainting is
2. Don't know how to test for it
3. Trust the backtest screenshots
4. By the time they discover it (live trading), money paid, no refund

### The Pine Script Default Problem

**TradingView's `request.security()` REPAINTS BY DEFAULT:**

```pine
// DEFAULT BEHAVIOR (Repaints!)
request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", close)

// NON-REPAINTING REQUIREMENT (Must explicitly set)
request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", close[1],
                lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_off)
```

**Most developers don't know this.** They use the default, create repainting indicators without realizing it.

### The "Looks Fine in Testing" Problem

If you only backtest and don't forward-test or paper trade, repainting is invisible:

```
Backtest: Perfect signals, great results
Paper Trade (if using replay mode): ALSO perfect (uses historical data)
Live Trading: Disaster (uses real-time data)

Many developers skip the final step.
```

---

## Part 4: How to Detect Repainting

### Test 1: The Screenshot Method

**Steps:**

1. Take screenshot of current chart with indicator signals
2. Wait 10-20 candles
3. Take another screenshot of the SAME time period
4. Compare signals

**Repainting indicator:** Signals changed, moved, or disappeared
**Non-repainting indicator:** Signals identical in both screenshots

**Example:**

```
Screenshot 1 (taken at 2:00 PM):
Candle at 1:00 PM: BUY signal
Candle at 1:30 PM: No signal

Screenshot 2 (taken at 4:00 PM, looking at same 1:00-1:30 period):
Candle at 1:00 PM: No signal (MOVED!)
Candle at 1:30 PM: BUY signal (APPEARED!)

Verdict: REPAINTING
```

### Test 2: The Replay Mode Method (TradingView)

**Steps:**

1. Go to historical date (e.g., 1 month ago)
2. Open Bar Replay mode
3. Step forward one candle at a time
4. Note where signals appear
5. Exit replay, look at same period in normal mode
6. Compare signals

**Repainting:** Signals in replay don't match signals in historical chart
**Non-repainting:** Perfect match

### Test 3: The Alert Log Method

**Steps:**

1. Set alerts on indicator signals
2. Trade for 1-2 weeks, log all alerts
3. After 2 weeks, look at historical chart
4. Check: Are signals where alerts fired?

**Repainting:** Alerts fired, but no signal exists at those candles
**Non-repainting:** Alert log matches historical signals

### Test 4: The Code Audit Method (Advanced)

**Check Pine Script for these red flags:**

```pine
// RED FLAG 1: request.security without lookahead_off
request.security(..., close)  // LIKELY REPAINTS

// RED FLAG 2: Offset of -1 or less (future candles)
value = close[-1]  // DEFINITELY REPAINTS

// RED FLAG 3: varip keyword (intrabar persistence)
varip float myvar = 0  // CAN REPAINT

// RED FLAG 4: strategy without calc_on_every_tick
strategy(..., calc_on_every_tick = false)  // REPAINTS

// GREEN FLAG 1: lookahead_off explicitly set
request.security(..., close[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_off)

// GREEN FLAG 2: Historical offset [1] or higher
value = close[1]  // Uses previous candle (safe)

// GREEN FLAG 3: Documentation states "non-repainting"
// (But verify with tests!)
```

---

## Part 5: The Signal Pilot Protocol - Deterministic by Design

### Why Signal Pilot Doesn't Repaint

**Core Principle: Close-Confirmed Signals Only**

```
Signal Pilot Rule:
"A signal exists only after the candle CLOSES with conditions met.
 The signal is calculated using data available at that close.
 The signal never changes."
```

**Implementation:**

1. **No Higher Timeframe on Incomplete Candles**

```pine
// Signal Pilot Approach
// Uses COMPLETED higher timeframe candles only

htf_condition = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf_input,
                                  condition[1],  // Previous candle
                                  lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_off)

// Always uses closed candles, never changing data
```

2. **No Future Data**

```pine
// Signal Pilot Never Does This:
future_value = close[-1]  // Future candle

// Signal Pilot Always Does This:
historical_value = close[1]  // Previous confirmed candle
current_value = close  // Current candle (for realtime plot only)
```

3. **No Intrabar Calculations (Strategy Mode)**

```pine
// Signal Pilot Strategies
strategy("SP Strategy", ..., calc_on_every_tick = true,
         process_orders_on_close = true)

// Every tick calculated, but orders only on CLOSE
// Backtest matches live execution
```

4. **All Conditions Must Hold at Close**

```pine
// Signal Pilot Logic
long_condition = (condition1 and condition2 and condition3)
plotshape(long_condition, ...)  // Only plots if true at CLOSE

// If condition is true mid-candle but false at close:
// No signal appears, no alert fires
```

### The SP Determinism Checklist

**Every Signal Pilot indicator meets these criteria:**

- [ ] Uses `lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_off` for all HTF data
- [ ] Uses historical offsets ([1] or higher, never [-1])
- [ ] Signals only plot/alert on candle CLOSE
- [ ] No `varip` unless deterministic (rare, well-documented)
- [ ] Strategies use `calc_on_every_tick = true`
- [ ] Strategies use `process_orders_on_close = true`
- [ ] Documentation explicitly states non-repainting
- [ ] Backtests match forward-test results

**Result:** What you see in backtest = what you get in live trading.

## Part 6: Auditing Other Indicators

### Your Indicator Audit Checklist

**Before using ANY indicator:**

```
===============================================
     INDICATOR REPAINTING AUDIT FORM
===============================================

INDICATOR NAME: _______________________
SOURCE: Marketplace / Custom / Free
DEVELOPER: _______________________

PRELIMINARY CHECKS:
☐ Does description claim non-repainting? Y/N
☐ Is source code visible? Y/N
☐ Are there backtest results shown? Y/N
☐ Is win rate over 75%? Y/N (If yes, very suspicious)

CODE AUDIT (if available):
☐ Uses request.security? Y/N
  ☐ If yes, has lookahead_off? Y/N
☐ Uses negative offsets ([-1])? Y/N (Red flag)
☐ Uses varip? Y/N
☐ Strategy: calc_on_every_tick = true? Y/N

SCREENSHOT TEST:
☐ Screenshot 1 taken: Date/Time: __________
☐ Screenshot 2 taken: Date/Time: __________
☐ Signals match between screenshots? Y/N

REPLAY TEST (TradingView):
☐ Replay date tested: __________
☐ Signals in replay match historical? Y/N

ALERT TEST:
☐ Alerts set for: _____ days
☐ Number of alerts: _____
☐ Alerts match historical signals? Y/N (%: __%)

LIVE PAPER TRADE:
☐ Paper trades: _____ (minimum 20)
☐ Win rate: _____%
☐ Backtest win rate: _____%
☐ Difference: _____%
  (>10% difference = likely repainting)

OVERALL VERDICT:
☐ Non-repainting (PASS)
☐ Repainting (FAIL - DO NOT USE)
☐ Uncertain (MORE TESTING NEEDED)

NOTES:
_________________________________________
_________________________________________

===============================================
```

### Red Flags You Can't Ignore

**AUTOMATIC FAIL:**

1. **Signals disappear or move** (Screenshot test)
2. **Win rate >80%** without proper drawdown disclosure
3. **Code has negative offsets** (close[-1])
4. **No source code available** + extraordinary claims
5. **Alert log doesn't match historical chart**
6. **Replay signals ≠ historical signals**

**INVESTIGATE FURTHER:**

1. **Uses request.security** but unclear on lookahead setting
2. **Win rate 65-80%** (possible, but verify)
3. **varip usage** (can be legitimate if deterministic)
4. **Strategy without order execution details**

**LIKELY SAFE:**

1. **Source code available and clean** (no red flags)
2. **Win rate 50-65%** (realistic)
3. **Developer explicitly addresses repainting** in documentation
4. **Community verified** (multiple independent tests)
5. **Passes all 4 detection tests**

---

## Part 7: Common "Non-Repainting" Lies

### Lie #1: "Based on Closed Candles"

**Claim:** "This indicator only uses closed candles, so it doesn't repaint."

**Truth:** Using closed candles FROM CURRENT TIMEFRAME is different from using closed candles FROM HIGHER TIMEFRAME.

```pine
// This REPAINTS despite using "closed candles"
daily_ema = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", ta.ema(close, 20))

// On 15m chart at 2:00 PM:
// Uses current day's EMA (changes until day closes)

// Non-repainting version:
daily_ema = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", ta.ema(close, 20)[1],
                              lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_off)
// Uses PREVIOUS day's EMA (fixed, doesn't change)
```

### Lie #2: "No Repainting, Only Signal Confirmation Delay"

**Claim:** "The indicator doesn't repaint, it just confirms slowly."

**Truth:** If the signal appears AFTER the optimal entry and shows perfectly in backtest AT the optimal entry, it's repainting.

**Example:**

```
Backtest: BUY signal appears at $45,000 (the exact low)
Live: BUY signal appears at $45,400 (after 5 candles)

Claim: "Just confirmation delay"
Reality: Backtest is using future information (repainting)
```

### Lie #3: "Alerts Don't Repaint, Only Visual"

**Claim:** "The chart display may change, but alerts are fixed."

**Truth:** If chart display changes, the logic is flawed. Alerts may SEEM consistent, but you're trading based on a different chart than backtest.

**Problem:**

```
Live:
- Alert fires at $45,000 (condition met)
- Enter trade at $45,000

Historical Chart:
- Signal shows at $45,200 (condition retroactively changed)
- Backtest enters at $45,200

Your trade at $45,000 isn't in the backtest!
Different entry = different results
```

### Lie #4: "Repainting Is Necessary for Accuracy"

**Claim:** "All good indicators must repaint to stay accurate."

**Truth:** This is completely false. Non-repainting indicators can be highly accurate. What they sacrifice is PERFECTION in hindsight, not accuracy in real-time.

**Reality:**

```
Repainting Indicator:
- Backtest: 85% win rate (using future data)
- Live: 45% win rate (actual performance)
- "Accuracy": Fake

Non-Repainting Indicator:
- Backtest: 58% win rate
- Live: 56% win rate
- Accuracy: Real
```

The non-repainting indicator is MORE accurate because backtest matches reality.

---

## Part 8: Building Trust in Indicators

### The 3-Phase Verification System

**Phase 1: Code Audit (If Possible)**

```
1. Request source code or verify on marketplace
2. Check for repainting red flags
3. Look for green flags (lookahead_off, etc.)
4. Read documentation thoroughly
5. Search for community reviews

Time: 30-60 minutes
Pass rate: Eliminates 70% of bad indicators
```

**Phase 2: Historical Testing**

```
1. Screenshot test (described earlier)
2. Replay test (TradingView)
3. Alert log test (1-2 weeks)
4. Compare backtest to forward test results

Time: 1-3 weeks
Pass rate: Eliminates 90% of remaining bad indicators
```

**Phase 3: Live Paper Trading**

```
1. Paper trade for 30-50 trades
2. Follow signals exactly as they appear real-time
3. Compare results to backtest stats
4. Variance within 10%? Pass. >15%? Fail.

Time: 1-3 months
Pass rate: Final verification, 95%+ confidence
```

**Only after passing all 3 phases: Use with real money.**

### The Trust Hierarchy

**HIGHEST TRUST (Use with Confidence):**

- Passed all 3 verification phases
- Open source code with no red flags
- Developer has proven track record
- Community verified over months/years
- Example: **Signal Pilot Indicators** (deterministic protocol)

**MODERATE TRUST (Use with Caution):**

- Passed phase 1 & 2, phase 3 in progress
- Code not fully visible but developer transparent
- Some community verification
- Use with reduced position size until fully verified

**LOW TRUST (Paper Trade Only):**

- Unverified claims
- No source code
- Limited track record
- Extraordinary claims (>80% win rate)
- Keep paper trading, don't risk capital

**ZERO TRUST (Avoid Completely):**

- Failed any verification test
- Signals disappeared or moved
- Code has red flags
- Developer won't provide evidence
- Community reports issues

---

## Part 9: The Performance Gap Analysis

### Measuring the Repainting Impact

**Your Personal Audit:**

```
Take your last 50 trades with current indicator:

1. Find each entry signal on historical chart NOW
2. Note the entry price shown on historical chart
3. Compare to actual entry price from journal

CALCULATION:
Avg Historical Entry: $_______  (from current chart view)
Avg Actual Entry: $_______  (from trade journal)
Difference: $_______

If difference >2% → Likely repainting
If difference <0.5% → Likely clean

Repeat for exits.
```

**Example Analysis:**

```
Indicator: "SuperTrend Pro"
Trades: 50

Historical (looking back now):
Avg Entry: $45,234
Avg Exit: $46,891
Avg Win: $1,657 per trade

Actual (from journal):
Avg Entry: $45,578
Avg Exit: $46,203
Avg Win: $625 per trade

Difference: $1,032 per trade (62% less profit)

Conclusion: Indicator is heavily repainting.
            Backtest showed $1,657/trade, reality is $625/trade.
```

### The Expectancy Reality Check

**Formula:**

```
Expected Value per Trade = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)

Backtest EV: _______
Live Trading EV: _______

Ratio: Live / Backtest = _______

Acceptable: 0.8 - 1.0 (live is 80-100% of backtest)
Warning: 0.5 - 0.8 (significant degradation)
Critical: <0.5 (likely repainting or curve-fitting)
```

**If ratio <0.8: Stop trading the indicator. Investigate.**

## Summary: Trust But Verify

### The Core Lesson

**Indicators are tools, not magic.**

Most aren't malicious—just poorly coded. But the result is the same: false confidence from fake backtests.

**Your job as a trader:**
- Verify before trusting
- Test before trading
- Monitor continuously
- Stay skeptical

### What You've Gained

**Skills:**
1. Repainting detection (4 methods)
2. Code auditing (red/green flags)
3. Performance gap analysis
4. Indicator verification protocol

**Protection:**
- Avoid 60-90% of misleading indicators
- Save months of wasted time on fake "edges"
- Build library of truly reliable tools
- Trade with confidence in your signals

### The Standard You Deserve

Signal Pilot operates on the **deterministic protocol**: What you see in backtest is exactly what you get in live trading.

No tricks. No repainting. No future data.

Demand the same from every indicator you use.

Your capital depends on it.
