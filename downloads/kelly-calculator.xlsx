KELLY CRITERION CALCULATOR
============================

Instructions:
1. Track your last 50-100 trades
2. Calculate Win Rate: (Winning Trades ÷ Total Trades) × 100
3. Calculate Average Win: Total $ Won ÷ Number of Wins
4. Calculate Average Loss: Total $ Lost ÷ Number of Losses
5. Enter values above

Kelly Formula: K = (W × R - L) ÷ R
Where:
- W = Win Rate (as decimal)
- L = Loss Rate (1 - W)
- R = Win/Loss Ratio (Avg Win ÷ Avg Loss)

Example:
- Win Rate: 60% (0.60)
- Avg Win: $400
- Avg Loss: $200
- R = $400 ÷ $200 = 2.0
- Kelly = (0.60 × 2.0 - 0.40) ÷ 2.0 = 0.40 = 40%

CRITICAL WARNING:
✗ Full Kelly (40%) = High growth, extreme drawdowns (50-70%)
✓ Half Kelly (20%) = 75% of growth, 25-40% drawdowns
✓ Quarter Kelly (10%) = 50% of growth, 15-25% drawdowns (RECOMMENDED)

Recommendation: Use Quarter Kelly (25% of calculated Kelly) for sustainable growth

Example Trading Strategy Results:
Strategy A: 55% win rate, 1.5:1 R/R → Full Kelly = 22.5% → Use 5.6% (Quarter)
Strategy B: 65% win rate, 2.0:1 R/R → Full Kelly = 47.5% → Use 11.9% (Quarter)
Strategy C: 45% win rate, 3.0:1 R/R → Full Kelly = 26.7% → Use 6.7% (Quarter)
