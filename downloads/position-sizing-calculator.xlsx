POSITION SIZING CALCULATOR
===========================

Instructions:
1. Enter your Account Size (total trading capital)
2. Enter your Risk Per Trade as a percentage (typically 0.5-1%)
3. Enter the Entry Price for your trade
4. Enter your Stop Loss Price
5. The calculator will show:
   - Shares to Buy = (Account Size × Risk%) ÷ (Entry - Stop)
   - Dollar Risk = Shares × (Entry - Stop)
   - Position Value = Shares × Entry Price

Example Calculation:
- Account: $100,000
- Risk: 1% = $1,000 max loss
- Entry: $520
- Stop: $510 (difference = $10)
- Shares: $1,000 ÷ $10 = 100 shares
- Position Value: 100 × $520 = $52,000

Formula: Position Size = (Account × Risk%) ÷ |Entry - Stop|

IMPORTANT: Your position VALUE can be large (50% of account) while only RISKING 1% if your stop is tight.
