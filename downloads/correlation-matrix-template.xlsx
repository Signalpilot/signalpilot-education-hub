PORTFOLIO CORRELATION MATRIX
==============================

How to Use:
1. List your positions in the Asset column
2. Calculate 30-day correlation between each pair using TradingView or Portfolio Visualizer
3. Fill in the correlation values (range: -1.00 to +1.00)
4. Identify dangerous concentrations (>0.70 = high correlation)

Correlation Interpretation:
+0.90 to +1.00: Extremely high correlation (essentially same position)
+0.70 to +0.89: High correlation (moves together often)
+0.30 to +0.69: Moderate correlation
-0.29 to +0.29: Low/no correlation (good diversification)
-0.30 to -0.69: Moderate negative correlation (hedge)
-0.70 to -1.00: High negative correlation (strong hedge)

Example Analysis - Tech Portfolio Problem:
SPY + QQQ + AAPL + MSFT + NVDA
Average correlation: 0.87 (TOO HIGH!)
This is essentially ONE bet, not 5 positions.

Example - Diversified Portfolio:
SPY + TLT + GLD + UUP
Average correlation: -0.04 (GOOD!)
True diversification - positions don't move together.

Effective N Formula:
Effective N = N ÷ √(Average Correlation)

Example: 5 positions with 0.80 avg correlation
Effective N = 5 ÷ √0.80 = 5 ÷ 0.89 = 5.6 ≈ 2 independent bets

ACTION ITEMS:
□ Check correlation before adding new position
□ If new position >0.70 correlated with existing, reduce existing or skip new
□ Target average portfolio correlation <0.40
□ Stress test: "If SPY drops 3%, what happens to ALL positions?"

Save and open in Excel to calculate portfolio correlations.
