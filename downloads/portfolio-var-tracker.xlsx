PORTFOLIO VALUE AT RISK (VAR) TRACKER
=======================================

95% VAR Definition:
On 95% of days, you won't lose more than the VAR amount.
On 5% of days (1 in 20), you WILL exceed VAR.

How to Calculate 95% VAR:
Method 1 - Historical:
1. Track daily returns for 60+ trading days
2. Sort returns from worst to best
3. 95% VAR = 5th percentile loss
   Example: If day 3 out of 60 = -4.8%, VAR = 4.8%

Method 2 - Volatility-Based:
95% VAR ≈ Portfolio Value × Daily StdDev × 1.65
Example: $100K portfolio, 2% daily volatility
VAR = $100,000 × 0.02 × 1.65 = $3,300

How to Use This Tracker:
1. Log portfolio value and P/L daily
2. Set your 95% VAR based on historical data or risk tolerance
3. Track when you exceed VAR (should happen ~1x per month)
4. If exceeding VAR >2x per month, you're underestimating risk

Red Flags:
⚠ Exceeding VAR 3+ times in one month
⚠ Actual loss >2× VAR (tail risk event)
⚠ VAR hasn't been exceeded in 6+ months (VAR too conservative)

Example Portfolio VAR Scenarios:
Conservative: $100K account, 3% VAR = $3,000 max daily loss (95% confidence)
Moderate: $100K account, 5% VAR = $5,000 max daily loss
Aggressive: $100K account, 8% VAR = $8,000 max daily loss

Action When VAR Exceeded:
1. Review: Was it one-off event or systemic?
2. Check correlation: Did all positions stop simultaneously?
3. Volatility spike: VIX >30? Reduce position sizes 50%
4. If exceeded 2x in one week: STOP trading, review risk model
