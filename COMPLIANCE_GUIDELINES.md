# Signal Pilot Compliance Guidelines
## Language Requirements for Educational & Documentation Materials

**Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: MANDATORY for all content

---

## 🎯 Purpose

These guidelines ensure our trading education materials and signal descriptions comply with financial services regulations and accurately represent our tools as educational resources showing market conditions, not trading directives.

This is critical for:

- ✅ Payment processor compliance (LemonSqueezy, Stripe, etc.)
- ✅ Accurate product representation
- ✅ Legal protection
- ✅ User trust and transparency

## 📛 Pentarch Signal Names & Descriptions

### Signal Names (Clean - No "Potential")

These are identifiers/names - like "Apple" or "Bitcoin". No compliance issue with the name itself.

- **TD** - Touchdown
- **IGN** - Ignition
- **CAP** - Climax
- **WRN** - Warning
- **BDN** - Breakdown

### When Describing What They Indicate (Add "Potential" + Use "Indicates")

**ALL signals use "indicates"** (never "confirms", "signals", "detects", "marks")

✅ **TD** - Touchdown → **Indicates** early-cycle reversal conditions
✅ **IGN** - Ignition → **Indicates** momentum breakout conditions
✅ **CAP** - Climax → **Indicates** late-cycle exhaustion conditions
✅ **WRN** - Warning → **Indicates** weakening momentum
✅ **BDN** - Breakdown → **Indicates** bearish breakdown conditions

### Pentarch Supporting Components (Always Use "Indicates" or "Shows")

**Pilot Line (PL):**
✅ "The Pilot Line **indicates** trend direction"
✅ "Green Pilot Line **shows** uptrend structure"
✅ "The PL **indicates** the reference point for distance metrics"
❌ "The Pilot Line **confirms** the trend"
❌ "The PL **tells you exactly** where to enter"

**Regime Bar Colors:**
✅ "Green candles **indicate** bull regime conditions"
✅ "The regime **shows** structural bias"
✅ "You **can see** the current regime from candle colors"
❌ "Green candles **confirm** you should buy"
❌ "The regime **tells you exactly** what to do"

**NanoFlow:**
✅ "NanoFlow **indicates** micro momentum conditions"
✅ "Green crosses **show** micro bull momentum"
✅ "NanoFlow **can validate** signal quality"
❌ "NanoFlow **confirms** the trend"
❌ "NanoFlow **tells you exactly** when to enter"

**Key Principle for All Components:**
- Use **"indicates"**, **"shows"**, **"can see"**, **"reveals"**
- Never use **"confirms"**, **"validates"**, **"proves"**, **"guarantees"**
- Never use **"tells you exactly"**, **"know exactly"**

|---------------|---------------------|
| potential bottom | early-cycle reversal |
| potential top | late-cycle exhaustion |
| bottom to top | early cycle to late cycle |
| marks the bottom | indicates early-cycle conditions |

| Capitulation (for CAP) | Climax |

## 🚫 Forbidden Words/Phrases

### NEVER use:

❌ **"bottom"** or **"top"** (use cycle language instead)
❌ **"know exactly"** (use "can see")
❌ **"tells you exactly"** (use "shows you")
❌ **"confirms"** (use "indicates")
❌ **"guarantees"** (except for technical features like "zero repaint")
❌ **"always"** / **"never"** (avoid absolutes about market outcomes)
❌ **"will happen"** (avoid future predictions)

---

## ✅ Safe Language Patterns

### ALWAYS use:

✅ **"indicates"** (not confirms/signals)
✅ **"shows"** (not tells)
✅ **"can see"** (not know exactly)
✅ **"conditions"** (not predictions)
✅ **"cycle position"** (not price direction)
✅ **"potential"** when describing outcomes

### Examples:

✅ "TD indicates potential early-cycle reversal conditions"
✅ "You can see where you are in the cycle"
✅ "Shows institutional activity patterns"

❌ "TD confirms a bottom is forming"
❌ "You know exactly when to buy"
❌ "Tells you what institutions are doing"

---

## 📝 Before & After Examples

### Example 1: Signal Description

**❌ Non-Compliant:**
> "When TD (Touchdown) fires, it confirms a bottom. This tells you exactly when selling pressure is exhausted. Traders know this is the entry point."

**✅ Compliant:**
> "When TD (Touchdown) fires, it indicates potential early-cycle reversal conditions. This shows you where selling pressure may be exhausting. Traders can see this as a possible point to consider for analysis."

### Example 2: Educational Content

**❌ Non-Compliant:**
> "The Pentarch system confirms market cycles through 5 phases. When you see TD → IGN, you know a bottom is in. When you see WRN → CAP → BDN, the top is confirmed."

**✅ Compliant:**
> "The Pentarch system indicates market cycle phases through 5 signals. When you see TD → IGN, you can see potential early-cycle conditions developing. When you see WRN → CAP → BDN, you can see potential late-cycle exhaustion."

### Example 3: Tool Documentation

**❌ Non-Compliant:**
> "Janus Atlas tells you exactly when a sweep has occurred, confirming the perfect entry point for your trade."

**✅ Compliant:**
> "Janus Atlas shows you when a sweep may have occurred, indicating possible areas for trade consideration in your analysis."

## 🎓 Emphasis on Educational Nature

Every piece of content should emphasize that these are:

### ✅ DO Include:

- "These are indicators to aid analysis"
- "Educational tools for understanding market conditions"
- "Part of your research process"
- "Shows possibilities, not certainties"
- "For educational purposes only"
- "Not financial advice"

### ❌ DON'T Imply:

- "Trading directives"
- "Guaranteed outcomes"
- "Professional recommendations"
- "Definitive predictions"
- "Sure things"
- "Can't-miss opportunities"

## ⚡ Quick Compliance Checklist

Before publishing ANY content, verify:

- [ ] All "bottom/top" references replaced with cycle language
- [ ] "Confirms" replaced with "indicates"
- [ ] "Tells you exactly" replaced with "shows you"
- [ ] "Know exactly" replaced with "can see"
- [ ] No language suggests signals are definitive predictions
- [ ] Educational disclaimers are prominent
- [ ] Materials emphasize these are analysis tools, not trading advice
- [ ] Language focuses on "possibilities" and "indicators" not "confirmations" or "certainties"
- [ ] Examples use "may," "might," "could," "potential" instead of "will," "is," "confirms"
- [ ] No guarantee language anywhere (except technical features)
- [ ] Proper risk warnings included

## 📚 Educational Disclaimer Template

Copy and adapt this disclaimer for your materials:

```
Educational Disclaimer:

[Product/Tool Name] provides educational tools designed to help traders
analyze market conditions and understand market cycle phases. All
signals and indicators show current market conditions based on historical
patterns and mathematical models—not predictions or guaranteed outcomes.

These materials are for educational purposes only and should not be considered
financial advice or trading recommendations. Past performance does not guarantee
future results. Trading involves significant risk of loss.

Always conduct your own research, understand the risks involved, and consider
consulting with qualified financial professionals before making trading decisions.

## 💬 Compliant Signal Language Examples

### When Mentioning Signals:

✅ "A TD Touchdown signal appeared"
✅ "Touchdown indicates potential early-cycle conditions"
✅ "CAP Climax shows late-cycle exhaustion"
✅ "You can see where institutional activity is strongest"

❌ "TD signals a potential bottom"
❌ "Buy when you see Touchdown"
❌ "CAP confirms the top"
❌ "You know exactly when to exit"

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Using "confirms", "know exactly", "bottom/top" sounds like:

- We're providing trading advice
- We're guaranteeing outcomes
- We're telling people what to do

### Using "indicates", "can see", "cycle position" sounds like:

- We're providing educational data
- We're showing information
- Users make their own decisions
