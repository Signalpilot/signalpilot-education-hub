# Signal Pilot Compliance Guidelines
## Language Requirements for Educational & Documentation Materials

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: MANDATORY for all content

---

## 🎯 Purpose

These guidelines ensure our trading education materials and signal descriptions are accurately represented as educational tools showing **potential** market conditions, not definitive predictions. This is critical for:

- ✅ Payment processor compliance (LemonSqueezy, Stripe, etc.)
- ✅ Accurate product representation
- ✅ Legal protection
- ✅ User trust and transparency

---

## ⚠️ Critical Rule: Always Use "Potential" Qualifiers

### ❌ INCORRECT (Remove These):

```
"TOUCHDOWN is a bottom signal"
"OUT is a reversal signal"
"CAP signals top"
"IGN confirms breakout"
"bottom forming"
"top approaching"
"exit now"
"reversal confirmed"
"breakout detected"
"breakdown imminent"
```

### ✅ CORRECT (Use These):

```
"TOUCHDOWN is a potential bottom signal"
"OUT is a potential reversal signal"
"CAP signals potential top"
"IGN signals potential breakout"
"potential bottom forming"
"potential top approaching"
"potential exit signal"
"potential reversal"
"potential breakout detected"
"potential breakdown"
```

---

## 📋 Key Terms Requiring "Potential"

| Term | Compliant Version | Context |
|------|------------------|---------|
| bottom signal | potential bottom signal | Any market bottom reference |
| top signal | potential top signal | Any market top reference |
| reversal | potential reversal | Direction changes |
| breakout | potential breakout | Price level breaks |
| breakdown | potential breakdown | Support failures |
| bottom forming | potential bottom forming | Pattern development |
| top forming | potential top forming | Pattern development |
| structure break | potential structure break | Chart patterns |
| topping completion | potential topping completion | Cycle analysis |

---

## 🔄 Definitive Language Replacements

### Replace These Definitive Terms:

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|---------|---------------|
| "confirms a bottom" | "suggests a potential bottom" |
| "confirms the breakout" | "suggests the potential breakout" |
| "signals reversal" | "signals potential reversal" |
| "indicates top" | "indicates potential top" |
| "the bottom is in" | "a potential bottom may be forming" |
| "exit now" | "potential exit signal" |
| "guaranteed" | "potential" or "possible" |
| "will reverse" | "may potentially reverse" |
| "must happen" | "could potentially happen" |

## 📝 Before & After Examples

### Example 1: Signal Description

**❌ Non-Compliant:**
> "When TD (Touchdown) fires, it detects a bottoming formation. This means selling pressure is exhausted after a downtrend. Traders can use this signal to enter reversal trades."

**✅ Compliant:**
> "When TD (Touchdown) fires, it detects a potential bottoming formation. This means selling pressure may be showing exhaustion after a downtrend. Traders can use this signal to consider whether a potential reversal might be developing."

### Example 2: Educational Content

**❌ Non-Compliant:**
> "The Pentarch system maps market cycles through 5 phases. When you see TD → IGN, you're observing a bottom development. When you see WRN → CAP → OUT, you're watching a top formation."

**✅ Compliant:**
> "The Pentarch system maps potential market cycles through 5 phases. When you see TD → IGN, you're observing a potential bottom development. When you see WRN → CAP → OUT, you're watching a potential top formation."

### Example 3: Tool Documentation

**❌ Non-Compliant:**
> "Janus Atlas confirms execution when a sweep has occurred, giving you the exact entry point for your trade."

**✅ Compliant:**
> "Janus Atlas suggests potential execution when a sweep may have occurred, helping you identify possible entry points for consideration in your analysis."

### ❌ DON'T Imply:

- "Definitive predictions"
- "Sure things"
- "Can't-miss opportunities"
